  developer: Bullet Proof Software
  publisher: Bullet Proof Software
  description:
    Tetris 4D is a fairly standard Tetris game that was released in Japan shortly
    after the Dreamcast launched.
    .
    The game features two modes, Classic and Battle. Classic mode offers a normal
    solitaire Tetris game: rotate and fit falling blocks to complete lines. Five
    difficulty settings are available, which change the speed and piece preview
    settings.
    .
    The sound and graphics generally follow a modern urban/industrial theme, with
    five techno music choices, including a variation of the classic Tetris
    "Karinka". The 3D backgrounds are basic but shift viewpoint as you advance in
    levels.
    .
    The Battle mode offers two to four player multiplayer. One player starts off
    flagged, and blocks push up from the bottom as other players make lines. Once he
    makes enough lines himself the flag moves to another player. Difficulty is set
    independently allowing for handicaps.
    .
    Unfortunately, you can't play the battle mode against the computer. There's also
    no VMU support for saving high scores, a rather critical omission for this type
    of game.

    three shots before they expire. The home version does include some mini-games

  developer: Goat Store Publishing
  publisher: Goat Store Publishing
  description:
    Based around the concept of falling blocks, much like the Columns, Lumines or
    Tetris, Irides is a puzzle action game with some clever twists around
    conventional ideas. A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block
    pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the
    player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the
    larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate
    and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color,
    which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one
    should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will "share" itself
    with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. When too many
    unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the
    playing field, the game ends.\n
    All the Skins in Irides have an outer space theme.

    Atari Anniversary Edition features 12 classic Atari games. The Dreamcast /
    Windows version contains the following games:\n
    -Asteroids\n
    -Asteroids Deluxe\n
    -Battlezone\n
    -Centipede\n
    -Crystal castles\n
    -Gravitar\n
    -Millipede\n
    -Missile Command\n
    -Pong\n
    -Super Breakout\n
    -Tempest\n
    -Warlords\n
    In addition to the pure emulation mode, there is an option that allows to
    display the original terminal around the game screen, which reinforces the
    impression of playing on an arcade machine. Each game allows you to activate a
    graphics improvement mode (variable depending on the game), for example
    "improved" Asteroids simply offers a static background, or "improved" Warlords
    offers a complete graphic overhaul with new colors. It should be noted that the
    improved version of Tempest is none other than Tempest Tubes, a Tempest mod
    designed in 1982 by Duncan Brown.\n
    Also included is a gallery of game images, a video interview with Nolan
    Bushnell, and desktop themes for Windows.

  game: Super Magnetic Neo

  developer: Crave Entertainment
  publisher: Crave Entertainment
  description:
    In Super Magnetic Neo, a gang lead by evil, foul-mouthed baby Pinki has taken
    over Pao Pao Park.  The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic
    Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head.
    .
    The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels
    have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an
    animal.  It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D
    platformer.  However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect.  Positive and
    Negative charges are represented by red and blue.  Neo's head can act as a
    positive or negative pole.  This is called his magnogimmick.  Using the
    principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull
    himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related
    environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on
    magnetic pendulums.  Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in
    to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.
    .
    You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao
    Park and defeat Pinki.
    .
    There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based
    around proper use of the magnogimmick.  It's something like the VR missions in
    the Metal Gear series.

    In this unique vertically-scrolling shooter you take the role of a mysterious
    girl named Karous, who commands a tiny fighter ship and attempts to destroy an
    evil armada bent on world domination.\n
    The game plays as your average vertical-scrolling shooter, in which you must
    clear several stages by destroying all incoming enemies and surviving their
    onslaught. A unique addition to Karous, is that you don't collect weapons by
    power-ups, but instead upgrade each of your basic weapons (gun, sword and
    shield) depending on their use thanks to a basic experience module, with
    increased power and features at later levels (multiple shots, bullet reflection,
    etc.)\n
    The game uses cel-shaded polygonal graphics with a distinct black and white
    look.

    4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the popular power-boat racing
    game, Hydro Thunder.  In this game, players race around two types of courses;
    huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in
    which to race, including various day/night, rain/sunshine variations. The game
    includes the standard championship, practice race, and 2-player modes.
    .
    The thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies
    not in careful steering and braking, but in finding the "boost" power-ups that
    lie around the tracks.  Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost
    meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of his or
    her truck dramatically. Without the boost power-ups, the player has no hope of
    winning a race.

    Much like Mario Party and Crash Bash, Sonic Shuffle has Sonic and his team
    playing a board game style tournament, where mini-games are at every turn.
    .
    Each character has a group of cards with a number on each. On every turn the
    player chooses a card to determine how many steps to take. When all of the cards
    have been used the deck is reshuffled, and each player gets a new hand. While a
    player can see only the numbers on their own cards, and not the numbers on other
    players' cards, they can still choose the cards of another player.
    .
    Each board has certain tiles: blue adds 3 rings to your total; red removes 3
    rings from your total and special tiles which places all of the players into a
    min-game or event.
    .
    The aim of the game, at the end of it all, is to get the Precioustone (1 per
    board).

    casino games. The game was fully licensed by the Caesars Palace casino and
    features six card games, table games, five slot machine themes, and video game
    machines. Each game plays by official Caesars Palace rules and uses casino odds
    and payouts verified by a Ph.D in statistics. The PC version of the game

    A slight change from the normal excessive number of F1 games out there, Spirit
    of Speed 1937 was an attempt to put you into the driving seat of some of the
    oldest, and well known, racing cars of the early-century. Take control of one of
    the 1930s cars and race it out around tracks, many of which are no longer
    available for professional competitive racing.
    .
    Whilst being a nice attempt to add some sparkle to a tired genre, many aspects
    of the game feel either wrong or awkward. Yes, the steering wasn't as nice on
    the old cars, but in simulating this the gameplay has become much harder. And
    why do all the cars shine as if made of polished chrome? A good attempt, but not
    one that rose to the surface of the day's gaming titles.

    power. Of course, they are all a mix of human and humanoid, and depending on
    their strengths, have a range of different moves and styles.
    .
    The main aim of the game is to defeat each of the opposing 3-man teams ahead of
    you, and dominate cyberspace.\n
    The game mixes a little of Street Fighter with a dash of Virtual On, allowing
    you to fight in close or use long range attacks all inside a 3D landscape.

    Licensed by snooker player Jimmy White, this game is a simulation of not only
    the British game of snooker, but also of the three main variations of pool.\n
    The game is viewed in detailed 3D, allowing you to rotate the table at all
    angles, either from overhead or using the cue position as a base. Taking a shot
    involves setting the exact pace and spin of it, and considering what each
    contact will do to the position of the cue ball, and any balls you may wish to
    pot afterwards. In the snooker mode playing accurate 'safety' shots (to prevent
    your opponent scoring) becomes important as well).
    .
    In each mode there are 10 computer opponents, and matches can consist of up to 9
    frames. A trick-shot editor is also included, allowing you to practice shots and
    set up challenges. Replays and an undo mode are also included. Bonus games are
    included as well - darts, draughts, a fruit machine, and even a remake of
    Dropzone, a Commodore 64 game from the same programmer.

    This is essentially the same game as the arcade light-gun rail-shooter House of

    of guns, your characters have keyboards strapped to them, and instead of
    shooting the zombies that constantly jump out at you you'll need to type out the
    words attached to the zombies in order to kill them before they crack open your
    head and feast upon the goo inside. The game ranks you on your typing speed and
    provides various tutorials and other edu-tainment sundries.
    .
    Otherwise it's pretty much the same game as House of the Dead 2. Much like the
    Resident Evil series, the zombie hordes have gone from infesting a vaguely
    gothic creepy old mansion to infesting a vaguely gothic decaying city, and its
    your job to stop them and save the human race (as usual).

  game: Triggerheart Exelica

  developer: Warashi
  publisher: Warashi
  description:
    In the distant future humanity will develop intelligent weapons called Trigger
    Hearts. Despite their awesome offensive strengths, Trigger Hearts aesthetically
    closely resemble humans, and overtime even develop unique personalities. Of
    three existing Trigger Hearts one, named Faintear, has mysteriously vanished two
    years ago.\n
    The story begins as the two remaining Trigger Hearts - Exelica and Crueltear
    (who took on the personality of Exelica's big sister) are summoned to quell a
    mysterious rebellion of military machines against their human creators.
    .
    Trigger Heart Exelica is an arcade-style top-down shooter and is composed of 5
    stages of shooting mayhem. Most levels take place in futuristic environments
    such as sky cities and space stations. The player is given a choice of one of
    the two Trigger Hearts at the beginning of the game - Exelica, who emits a wide
    fan of weak shots, and Crueltear, who fires a narrowly concentrated barrage of
    projectiles. However, the firing pattern of guns matters little during the game,
    as Trigger Heart's most awesome weapon is common to both models, and is called
    the Anchor Shot. By using the Anchor Shot Trigger Hearts are able to grab,
    swing, use as a shield, and hurl back any flying enemy vehicle in the game,
    including even the most giant of enemy battle cruisers. When thrown, the enemy
    cuts a path of destruction across the entire screen, causing explosive chain
    reactions between adjacent ships and occasionally even obliterating bosses in
    one hit. The Anchor Shot is a tricky weapon to use, as it requires the player to
    circle the joystick in order to give enemy ships more inertia while continuing
    to dodge enemy fire. The trajectory of the released enemy is also somewhat
    difficult to predict. Another innovative feature of Trigger Heart Exelica is
    AI-adjusted boss difficulty level, which will cut more slack to the
    inexperienced player, while attempting to punish the pros.
    .
    In addition to the original Arcade mode the home version of the game includes a
    Story mode, which adds fully voiced cutscenes, additional endings and bosses
    throughout the game, and Arranged Mode, which is just like the arcade mode, but
    is limited to Normal difficulty, no continues, and only two lives, and serves as
    a challenge to the most experienced players.
    .
    The PS2 port includes a new opening movie, story mode and CG sequences. TH44
    Faintear is now a player selectable fighter and The Triggerheart Backupper
    C'r_na, originally only a story concept, now appears in the game.

    "Mandragorans", making them go berserk and kill people, even their loved ones,
    without thinking. The ruler of the castle, Baron Balzac, learns of Guts killing
    a Mandragoran and brings him to the dungeon where people infected with the
    disease are kept. Balzac brings Guts to his laboratory while explaining that he
    is searching for a supposed cure. Guts learns from Balzac that the disease comes
    from an unusual plant, the Mandragora that grew into a tree located in a nearby
    village on the borders of his domain. After meeting a group of rebels that
    abducted Casca and learning the baron is a tyrant to their people, Guts decides
    to carry out Balzac's request for the Great Tree's heart since the baron's
    findings might provide a cure for Casca's madness. But while Guts is joined by
    Rita and a group of rebels, Balzac's men raid the rebels' hideout and capture
    Casca.

    A kangaroo named Kao was playing with his friends in his native Australia, when
    suddenly evil hunters appeared, put him in a cage, and took him away. They
    didn't know that Kao was quite proficient in the art of boxing, so freeing
    himself from the trap wasn't particularly hard. However, Kao finds himself far
    away from home, and must fight and hop his way back.

    Kao the Kangaroo is a 3D platform action game. The gameplay adheres to the
    jump-and-run style, Kao having to rapidly traverse levels full of traps and
    enemies. His basic attack is a simple punch; he can also side-step and swing his
    tail at the enemies. Power-ups scattered through the stages include coins, a
    certain amount of which will increase Kao's life points; hearts to replenish his
    health; boxing gloves, which act as homing projectile attacks; and turbo boosts,
    which make Kao move faster.

    World Neverland Plus is similar to Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, you find

    a job, take care of his farm, get married, have children (then take back your
    child's life when your character dies). There are 3 organizations to join, a bit
    of fighting, but generally this is all pretty calm and involves `` living ''
    your character's life.

    Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for batting and pitching,
    switching to different views after the ball is hit.  The famous limitation of
    World Series Baseball 2K1 is that you cannot control the fielders until after
    the ball is fielded!  For this reason the game was almost universally panned by
    reviewers upon its release.  This flaw was fixed in subsequent releases of the
    World Series Baseball franchise.

    mines. Help is received from a pair of helicopters that drop ammo and provide
    healing.

    spin by going forward with one track and backwards with the other. Moreover the
    turret can be turned in any direction. The camera always moves with the turret
    sometimes diverting the view towards the camera. The angle of the turret and the
    distance the rockets travel can be changed. The tank can only be controlled
    using the keyboard.

    In Super Magnetic Neo, a gang lead by evil, foul-mouthed baby Pinki has taken
    over Pao Pao Park.  The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic
    Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head.
    .
    The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels
    have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an
    animal.  It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D
    platformer.  However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect.  Positive and
    Negative charges are represented by red and blue.  Neo's head can act as a
    positive or negative pole.  This is called his magnogimmick.  Using the
    principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull
    himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related
    environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on
    magnetic pendulums.  Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in
    to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.
    .
    You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao
    Park and defeat Pinki.
    .
    There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based
    around proper use of the magnogimmick.  It's something like the VR missions in
    the Metal Gear series.

    Atmark's Net Versus series features 7 board game titles for the DC, all released
    at the same time, simple looking.\n
    It starts off a little weird, as the intro sees a spaceship, planets, and, uh,
    no chess at all. There is no doubt that this is linked to the functionality of
    the online game. On the menu of the game itself, it's simple menus, and while
    there is quite a bit of customization, everything is very basic. As the only
    chess title in DC, the game conveys the tactical vibe of chess well. Solo or 2
    player always possible thanks to offline play.

  description:
    The story of this game is in 2 parts. The 1st dedicated to a group of students
    going on a hike in the Japanese Alps. The main hero, Yuuichi Takawashi, dies in
    an accident during this outing. Through soul reincarnation, you are going to
    play out Yuuichi's memories, but in order to return the memories of his soul, it
    is necessary to have someone in your heart that you really want to meet. The
    story goes back to the memories of his 3rd year of high school until the day of
    his accident. The second is the awakening of Yuuichi in a hospital, but in the
    body of the heroine chosen in the first part. You want to tell people that you
    are still alive, but since you are not really you, it is quite difficult. Time
    is running out before the soul decides to merge, 2 souls cannot occupy the same
    body, the one that does not merge will disappear, and if Yuuichi's soul merges,
    he will continue to live in that body.

  description:
    When the protagonist of Bokomu no Tatsujin surrenders to the Sandman and drifts
    off to sleep, it's time to engage in a board game. Populated with strangely
    themed mini-games and scenarios, our hero gets to confront/unleash hidden
    "alter-egos" with which he can succeed. The mini games invariably involve
    Pavlovian button tapping, repetitive pattern matching, and fairly simple button
    sequencing to succeed. Drawn in a wavering childish scrawl, the visuals help to
    convey a feel of a dreamy netherworld, both tenuous and seemingly fleeting in
    it's existence.

    that finds it. Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus
    must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in
    shooter duels.
    .
    The game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling
    your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The
    difference in this game is that each player has his own play area,  a la Puyo
    Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus
    chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an
    attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to
    special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special "boss"
    characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.
    .
    Each player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and
    collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you
    can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs

    given a choice of three different mecha-ships - one with a spread-gun, a weak
    homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun. Additionally, each ship can use
    a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can't be
    killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the
    player lets go of the fire button, and a smart-bomb-like field that can be
    extended around the player  in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing their
    shots and turning them into points.

  developer: FortyFive

  description:
    Tokyo Bus Guide is a bus simulation, which as its name suggests takes place in
    and around Tokyo. It's a great game, addicting and fun to play. At the
    beginning, we can find it a bit slow, but after a little adaptation time, we
    stick to it very quickly.\n
    Unfortunately, it was only distributed in Japan.\n
    As this game is Japanese, it will therefore be necessary to adapt to driving on
    the left; which is not obvious at first glance. But with a little practice, you
    get used to it.\n
    Obviously, you have to pay attention to all signs and respect the highway
    code.\n
    To score well, it goes without saying that you have to arrive more or less on
    time at each stop without exceeding the speed limits (under penalty of penalty
    points). You will also need to ensure the comfort of passengers ...\n
    You will also need to open and close the bus doors at each stop as well as
    announce the next station.\n
    Be careful, Tokyo Bus Guide is not a "crazy taxi" type arcade game, if you are
    in too much of a hurry and make too many infractions and mistakes; it will be a
    game over for sure.

    Wild Metal Country is an action game in which one of five little tanks can be
    selected to control. Tank-like machines have gone wild on the three different
    planets of the Tehric system and the player's job is to defeat them.
    .
    The battles take place in desolate mountain environments. The big differences in
    altitude play an important role in the game. In the single player mode, complete
    levels by collecting 8 colored power cores, which are defended by the machines,
    and returning them to one of several hovering stores. The player has an infinite
    amount of lives. The weaponry consists of 8 types of missiles and 4 types of
    mines. Help is received from a pair of helicopters that drop ammo and provide
    healing.
    .
    The two tracks of the tank are operated independently. For example, make a quick
    spin by going forward with one track and backwards with the other. Moreover the
    turret can be turned in any direction. The camera always moves with the turret
    sometimes diverting the view towards the camera. The angle of the turret and the
    distance the rockets travel can be changed. The tank can only be controlled
    using the keyboard.
    .
    Noteworthy aspects of the game are: the physics modelling, the 3D engine and the
    amount of freedom the player has (no time constraints etc.).

    Whilst being a nice attempt to add some sparkle to a tired genre, many aspects
    of the game feel either wrong or awkward. Yes, the steering wasn't as nice on
    the old cars, but in simulating this the gameplay has become much harder. And
    why do all the cars shine as if made of polished chrome? A good attempt, but not
