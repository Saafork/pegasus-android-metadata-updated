  respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the prosperous
  land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors
  who have been protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and
  warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, and during your
  adventure you'll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries.
  .
  The most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can
  tackle many missions in any order you want, and the storyline also changes
  depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss enemy, the
  game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed.
  Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring
  overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based combat.

file: Whac-A-Mole (USA).zip
developer: Activision
publisher: Activision
description:
  This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld
  devices. At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As
  the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you
  have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and
  tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a
  marker around the screen.
  .
  The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode,
  were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time
  goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard
  mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the
  standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you
  will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka
  moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which
  once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the
  time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's
  own graphical theme.
  .
  The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In
  the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen.
  This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two
  puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row
  before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to
  empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear
  on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new
  moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a
  mole in that location.
  .
  The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many
  levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful.
  The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.

file: Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2 - Bush Rescue (USA, Europe) (En,Fr,De).zip
developer: EA Games
publisher: EA Games
description:
  The Game Boy Advance rendition of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue is
  essentially a 2D-ized version of the 3D console design. The GBA title follows
  the exact story structure of the console platformer, right down to the still
  screens lifted out of the animated cutscenes. Gameplay-wise, Ty 2 is a
  traditional platformer that puts heavy emphasis on boomerang action. Players
  control Ty through huge levels that go all over the map; up, down, left,
  right... and each location and situation on the handheld is based specifically
  on the same location and situation in the console. The sprite graphics of Ty and
  his pals have been rendered from the 3D assets of the console bigger brother to
  retain a consistent feel throughout the game design. There are elements that are
  original to the GBA game; character profiles during conversations, for example,
  are supplied by drawn stills unique to the handheld game.

  One of the Game Boy Advance's launch titles from Majesco (alongside Boxing Fever
  and Iridion 3D), F-14 Tomcat is essentially a port of Absolute Entertainment's
  1994 SNES game Turn and Burn: No-Fly Zone. The game content is exactly the same,
  but it features a multiplayer mode between other systems (if they have a copy of
  the game and the GBA Link Cable, of course) and a brand new storyline: the
  player controls a F-14 pilot chosen by the US government to be assigned in the
  theater of operations of a war between the republics of China and Taiwan to
  protect America's "interests" in the region.
  .
  The game includes, apart from the previously mentioned multiplayer mode, a
  landing practice mode, like Turn and Burn. It was later implemented in Majesco's
  two following GBA flight sims, 2004's Super Hornet F/A-18F and 2007's F24
  Stealth Fighter, which re-used this game's engine, with the option of selecting
  between a landing carrier or a landing strip.

developer: Bam Entertainment
publisher: Bam Entertainment
description:
  Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic
  first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an
  allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as
  shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three
  final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available
  in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to be played in
  sequence to be enjoyed!
  .
  In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but
  overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of
  his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for
  an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied
  territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has
  to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released
  into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal:
  infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic
  suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical
  warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr.
  Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is
  capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode
  Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the
  chemical assault.
  .
  Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a
  secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels.
  Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many
  enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where
  the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies
  (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight
  bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire
  power), and depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and
  golden keys to open certain doors.
  .
  Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog
  food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points.
  There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them
  using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at
  the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret
  areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere
  in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast,
  but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular
  brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers
  (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS
  Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants
  (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green
  clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).
  .
  Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player
  loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either
  find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and
  capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all
  enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure
  points).

game: Dark Empire
file: Dark Empire (Japan) (Proto).zip
description:
  Dark Empire is an unreleased RPG that was in development by Marvelous
  Entertainment for the GameBoy Advance. This project was previusly unknown, until
  an auction for its prototype was posted on Ebay in June 2009. As we can read
  from the item description:
  .
  Original promo/sample game was never released or completed, game is playable but
  only around 30% complete. Very good graphics for Gameboy Advance, you have a
  world map, a castle you can go to and a village. Ingame text is Japanese,
  developer most probably Marvelous Entertainment.\n
  The developers used some real photos (as one of Mel Gibson from the Braveheart
  film) as placeholders for the characters avatars in the game, before the final
  ones were finished. The gameplay would have probably been like a traditional RPG
  / SRPG, and looking at one of the photos added in the auction it seems that
  there were some 3D scenes too (maybe for the combats?).

  Over the years, toy fads come and go, but the truly great toys are always
  popular. This is true of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS, a game that pits a blue
  robot against a red robot in a boxing match. DSI Games and Full Fat, recognizing
  the popularity of the toy, has created a Game Boy Advance version of ROCK â€˜EM
  SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS so players no longer need to have their punching robot handy
  to go a few rounds. The core concept of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS transfers
  over to the GBA with no problem. Players select which of the robots they want to
  control and get into the ring, punching and blocking their way to victory.
  Gamers can practice, play a quick fight, or enter a tournament to see if they
  can claim the title of Rock â€˜em Sock â€˜em master. The game also features a
  two player mode using the Game Boy Advance Link, giving players the chance to
  battle their friends in much the same way they would play with the toy. This is
  the real joy of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS because playing against a friend
  really captures the feel of the classic robot battling game. Players who enjoy
  playing with the robot boxing toys will love ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS. The
  toy translates over to the virtual world very well, and the game perfectly
  captures the classic feel and look of the toys.

  Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your
  chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of
  Street Fighter)
  .
  Versus - Two human players battle it out.
  .
  Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a
  dummy.
  .
  Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload

  Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown;
  pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball
  while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a
  samurai; and much more.  At the end of each set of stages is a 'remix stage' -
  in this stage, sections of the previously played stages are combined and thrown

game: Shining Force : Resurrection of the Dark Dragon
file: Shining Force - Resurrection of the Dark Dragon (USA).zip
developer: THQ
publisher: THQ
description:
  Shining Force is a turn-based tactical RPG. Battles take place in square grids,
  and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of
  squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on
  its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one
  action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands,
  such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns
  is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.
  .
  In Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her
  own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although
  there are no "generic" units, except on the enemy side, most characters
  contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.
  .
  Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that
  unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be
  promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the
  character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount,
  although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.
  .
  Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the
  enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they
  kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by
  casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover
  allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained,
  regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the
  player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results
  in the player losing half of their money.

  Monster Rancher Advance is a monster raising sim that allows players to raise
  and customize 440 monster types. These monsters can then be tested in in-game
  tournaments, or battled against other players in 2P mode with the GBA link
  cable.
  .
  Monsters are created in the game's shrine through the entry of letters, numbers
  and punctuation symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4
  characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8
  characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations
  of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but each monster
  can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique.
  .
  Players then train the monsters by choosing  which foods to feed, which drills
  to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for new attacks, and
  what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with
  which food and items can be purchased, more money is earned in tournaments.
  Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and
  juggling a bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters
  age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better
  attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies.
  Monsters do not die in this game, however, they do face an enforced retirement
  age.
  .
  There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where some characters from older
  Monster Rancher games visit, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay
  itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended and has unlimited
  replay value.
  .
  The 2 Player mode, involving a link cable and two copies of the game, allows
  players to test the monsters they have raised against other players. The 2P mode
  also allows players to trade items and cash with one another, to wager items or
  cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters into each others' games.

  Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious
  black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting

  must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin,

  plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall
  buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and

  fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for
  doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he
  shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid
  teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If
  he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted.

  ZooCube is a puzzle game that involves matching parts of animals to eliminate
  them and get points.
  .
  The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall
  towards it. In a similar style to Tetris the player must keep the sides from
  building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the
  player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all
  sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make
  life more difficult for the player's opponents, such as by speeding up the rate
  at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can
  spin.

developer: Jamie Woodhouse
publisher: Jamie Woodhouse
description:
  In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest
  score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the
  fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to
  complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated.
  .
  You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the
  door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before
  spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels.
  At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you
  have a certain amount of time to defeat them.
  .
  You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier
  levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out
  that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls
  would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give
  you chocolate eggs.
  .
  Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a
  gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps
  in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by
  spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware,
  getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again.
  .
  Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a
  level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending
  on gameplay, there are  also tricks where the last key you have to get flies
  away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see
  enemies, and running away from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus points at
  the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.
  .
  Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at
  budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.

developer: Nintendo

description:
  bit Generations: Dialhex is a Game Boy Advance video game released in 2006 by
  Nintendo and skip, Ltd. The game was part of the initial batch of bit
  Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake
  of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii's WiiWare service, was
  released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was
  instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex.
  .
  Gameplay\n
  In Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal
  of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains
  triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a set amount of
  points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles
  in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of
  a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit
  another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of
  them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the
  amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button,
  or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come
  down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player
  progresses through the game.
  .
  Once you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green
  and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be
  added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors,
  including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple,
  cyan, and a darker green.
  .
  After you've reached a certain point in the game's main mode, you'll be given
  access to the title's endless mode. In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as
  long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game
  starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop
  just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends
  until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock the staff credits, you just
  need to create six cyan hexagons in the game's main mode. After doing this the
  credits will be available on the game's main screen.

description:
  Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were
  kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting
  unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to
  combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of
  aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.
  .
  The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead
  of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so
  on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the
  Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout
  has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to
  stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including
  switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings
  as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.
  .
  The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any
  point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to
  keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them
  all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and
  the level must be restarted.

  Lan, Chaud, Dex and other characters from the Mega Man Battle Network Universe
  prepare to duke it out in the Battle Chip GP!  Take control of your favorite
  character and face off against many opponents as you make your way to the head
  of the GP to reach the ultimate prize, an incredibly rare battle chip!
  .
  Gameplay is based around the Mega Man Battle Network series of games, in that
  players purchase and use various battle chips to combat their opponents.
  However, unlike the main games, players do not have direct control over their
  Net Navi.  Instead, players pre-select their battle chips, and one of these
  chips are used in the battle against the opponent.  Once selected, the game
  automatically plays out the battle.
  .
  There is also a process called 'slotting in', which can be performed by pressing
  L or R during battle when your slot in gauge is full.  Slotting in allows you to
  use an additional battle chip during gameplay to assist you.  If successful, the
  chip will be used, and aid you with healing, dealing extra damage, and so on.

  have been translated into other languages.

  of Konami's role-playing video game series. Several cards also feature
  characters who would later go on to appear in Suikoden III.

  In the Game Boy Advance version of Shrek the Third, you must complete levels
  playing as a combination of Shrek, Prince Artie, Puss in Boots, and Donkey. The
  levels are mostly puzzles, where you can only access certain areas with a

  the end. Each character has special abilities, such as Shrek's ground pound to
  break through pits in the ground.
  .
  You will encounter many different AI types throughout gameplay, including evil
  witches, arrow-shooting guys, gnomes, etc. There are collectible faeries in each
  level that you must collect enough of to progress to the next world.
  .
  This is a simple platformer-puzzle game that is mostly geared towards children,
  seeing as there are no lives, and relatively simple combat, but it should also
  appeal to adults who enjoy the Shrek franchise.

developer: Jamie Woodhouse
publisher: Jamie Woodhouse
description:
  In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest
  score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the
  fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to
  complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated.
  .
  You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the
  door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before
  spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels.
  At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you
  have a certain amount of time to defeat them.
  .
  You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier
  levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out
  that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls
  would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give
  you chocolate eggs.
  .
  Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a
  gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps
  in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by
  spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware,
  getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again.
  .
  Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a
  level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending
  on gameplay, there are  also tricks where the last key you have to get flies
  away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see
  enemies, and running away from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus points at
  the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.
  .
  Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at
  budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.

  bit Generations: Coloris is a Game Boy Advance video game that was released

  required to place three similarly colored tiles next to each other in order to
  rid of them. However, unlike most games like this, you don't swap the tiles but
  rather start to change the color of the tile by pressing on them with the
  cursor.
  .
  Each step of the game the cursor will be one of the three colors that are in
  play. If there's a red, blue and purple tile, then clicking on a blue tile with
  a red cursor won't automatically turn it into that color but will rather turn it
  purple. By continually pressing that tile with a red cursor, however, will
  eventually change it into a red tile. As you progress through the game, and

description:
  DROOPY'S TENNIS OPEN for Game Boy Advance has a total of six characters each
  with their own individual and unique set of characteristics and attributes. The
  player can choose from Droopy, Dripple, Butch, Bubbles, Vavoom, MC Wolf, and
  Screwy Squirrel. Each game can be played on a background that ranges like a
  jail, outside of an Old West saloon, and the North Pole with varying terrain
  like grass, clay, and ice. Games can be played in a two-player mode over a
  single cart and even up to four players with the support of a Game Boy Advance
  link cable. It will even support the Game Boy Advance's downloadable link for
  players without requiring a copy of the game. One of the best ways to play this
  game is in the arcade mode. This mode lets players use special impressive
  attacks when they build up their powers. The character called 'Vavoom' can set
  in motion a flirty ball that will dodge and sidestep swings. Droopy can blast
  off three balls of terror at once for players to panic over and attempt to
  retrieve them. In general, Butch has the most strength while Screwy possesses
  extraordinary athletic abilities. This arcade style game is a fun way to
  participate in an entertaining game with classic characters many already know
  and love. DROOPY'S TENNIS OPEN is sure to draw new fans of the classic cartoon
  characters as they are just as endearing and entertaining as they have always
  been in their cartoon shorts.

description:
  Kururin Paradise is the sequel to the GBA launch title, Kuru Kuru Kururin. In
  this game, Kururin and his family see an advertisement for the circus, which
  takes place at 6:00. Kururin's family arrive there on time, but Kururin is late,
  and when he gets there, everybody is missing! It's up to Kururin to search
  across the land for his missing family using his faithful helicopter, the
  Heririn. As in the first game, Kururin must navigate his way through fairly
  narrow mazes, trying not to hit the walls. Three consecutive hits, and the
  Heririn is destroyed, and you must start the stage again.
  .
  Paradise is vastly improved from the original game. It is now possible to find
  hidden keys in the levels, which open up locked doors, allowing for branched
  paths in the world map. Certain paths also lead to boss encounters, which take
  the form of an addictive mini-game including, but not limited to, lawn mowing,
  gathering stars, flying Kururin himself through clouds, and hopping across a
  path dodging helicopter blades. If you beat the boss, these mini-games are then
  added to your mini-game library, where you can play them against up to three
  friends using only one cart.
  .
  The game also features twelve toys built in that can be accessed by selecting
  one from a menu, then turning your GBA off, then on again. Most of them are
  fairly useless or incomprehensible in Japanese, but there are a couple of
  interesting ones, like the love tester, the musical note player, and the memory
  match game.

  Eragon for the Game Boy Advance is a traditional turn based RPG with a combat

  allows a lot of replayability.

  an important future, on his perilous journey to avenge his father, rescue the
  woman of his dreams and join forces with the Varden in their war against King

  are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems
  to be involved with them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!
  .
  The Game Boy Advance version of TMNT can be best described as similar to the NES
  game River City Ransom.  Players take control of either a specific turtle or the
  turtle of their choice (depending on the mission), and fight through waves of
  enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style.  Enemies will drop the usual health
  pickups, but also drop money and weaponry.  Money can be used to purchase
  weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be used as a more
  powerful tool to defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a limited use).
  After the completion of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain
  amount of experience is gained, you can level up the turtles to improve their
  fighting statistics.
  .
  Each turtle has their own specific weapon: Leonardo with his dual Katana,
  Michelangelo with his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with
  his two Sai.  These weapons are used in their standard attacks.  A basic attack
  is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and
  other buttons such as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button.
  Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be performed, and you can even
  juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.

  features you'd expect out of a racing game. There's a good variety of colorful
  and light-hearted tracks (15 in all, including a wide variety of themes such as
  jungles, deserts, busy city streets, ice tracks, and gravel-covered hills),
  nearly a dozen Digimon to pick from and unlock, and several gameplay modes
  ranging from cup races to time trials. A handful of boss races round out the
  action, and provide a challenge for players.
  .
  The twist to this game comes as the racers collect energy on the track to
  digivolve into upgraded versions of themselves. Once you've digivolved, you can
  use additional offensive powers to further hamper your opponents and keep your
  own Digimon ahead of the others.
  .
  While the single-player game will keep you busy for a while with its many modes
  and characters, Digimon Racing really shines in the multiplayer arena. Since it
  includes support for up to four players using the link cable or wireless
  adapter, the multiplayer experience is the real highlight of the game.

  vertical shooter where Spyro floats around blasting sheep or collecting gems, a
  rapid-button-tapping challenge involving tug-o-war and ice cube creation, or

  Breakout-style challenge. The game supports link cable play for multiplayer

game: Super Collapse! II
file: Super Collapse! II (USA).zip
developer: Majesco
publisher: Majesco
description:
  The game concept is that you have to eliminate clusters of at least 3 blocks
  with your mouse, but the more you remove at once, the more you score. Once that
  happens, all blocks above the ones, which have vanished, will fall down and
  close the gap.
  .
  Beneath the lowest row, there you see the new row building up. Once all blocks
  are present, this row will be now the lowest row, while all others are moving
  up. Once one block reaches the top of the playfield, you loose.
  .
  Each individual level has a preset value of rows, which will build up. To win a
  level, all you have to do, is to prevent that a full vertical row (from bottom
  to top) gets stacked up.
  .
  The game offers 4 game modes: Traditional, Puzzle, Relapse, and Strategy. Two of
  them need a brain, while the other two just need a fast hand.
  .
  Traditional works like explained above. New rows show automatically, with
  increasing speed not only from level to level, but also in a level. Means: the
  level starts slow, but in the end, new rows will complete every second.
  Power-Ups are available in this game mode.
  .
  Relapse works exactly like Traditional, but with one major difference. The
  action isn't just limited to the bottom of the playfield, in fact, both bottom
  and top now filling with blocks. Power-Ups used on one side affecting both. How
  to win is the same, but you loose, when blocks from one side touching the other.
  .
  Strategy is one of the two game modes where you must think. Clicking fast will
  only help to see the Game Over screen. New rows won't appear automatically,
  instead for each cluster you remove, a full new line will appear. So you have to
  plan carefully before neutralizing a cluster.
  .
  Puzzle is the game mode, where no new lines appear. Also there are no Power-Ups
  here. But this is the most complex game mode. Your task is to completely remove
  all blocks, if at least one block is still available, you loose. There is also
  no time limit, so you can think as long as you want.
  .
  The first three game modes offering bonus levels, which works like the Puzzle
  mode. So, if one block remains, you only scoring the normal points for removed
  clusters. Only when all blocks are removed, you score the bonus points. There
  are only two differences: it isn't so complex, and you only have 15 seconds
  time.
  .
  There are 5 different Power-Ups in the game (2 good, 2 bad, 1 depending of the
  situation): Platform Block (won't move, just blocking the vertical row where it
  is), Indestructible Block (does move like a regular block, but can't removed
  with normal actions), Color Bomb (one of each of the 5 colors, will detonate all
  same colored blocks in it's big radius), Super Bomb (shorter range than the
  Color Bomb, but blow up all blocks, regardless the color; only way to remove
  Platform/Indestructible Blocks), and finally, the Gravity Block (only available
  in Relapse Mode, will shift all blocks from the side where it was activated to
  the other side).

  to be avoided such as balloons and various animals on the ground. As usual
  though you'll need to experiment to find out just what's worth hitting and
  what's not.
  .
  One of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and
  secrets but they've always been well concealed and you're more likely to
  discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won't spoil some
  of the goodies we've discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders
  that could be spun around trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then
  shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus. Finally the hi-score chart is
  still there as is the wonderful battery back up so you can prove that you did
  actually get a score over 50.

  Four classic Pac-Man games are included in this collection from Namco:
  .
  1. Pac-Man: The original arcade classic, complete and un-cut.\n
  2. Pac-Mania: A conversion of the 1987 update to Pac-Man, which takes the
  elements of the original arcade game and puts it into an isometric view, as well
  as adding the ability to jump.\n
  3. Pac-Man Arrangement: Never re-produced outside of the arcade, Arrangement
  again uses the elements of the original Pac-Man and adds a fifth ghost, who can
  change shape and size when combined with the other 4 ghosts, and make life
  harder for Pac-Man. New power-ups are also included, like the ability to dash
  quickly around the screen, warp points to get from one place to the other and
  new ways of catching ghosts.\n
  Pac-Attack: Like Tetris before it, you must fit falling blocks together to
  complete a line to clear the screen. In this case, the falling tiles also have
  ghosts in them, and once the Pac-Man tile appears (a tile with the Pac-Man
  symbol), Pac-Man will eat all of the ghosts that are in his path until he gets
  to a dead end.

developer: Activision
publisher: Activision
description:
  Based on the movie (and first three books of the series), Lemony Snicket's a
  Series of Unfortunate Events for Game Boy Advance puts players in the
  unfortunate shoes of the incredibly unlucky Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus,
  and Sunny.
  .
  Each orphan has an unusual talent that will let them progress through three
  chapters (each with over a dozen levels). Though the game looks like a
  traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat to clever puzzle-solving and
  adventure game elements. The three orphans must use their talents, along with
  items found in the world, and various interactions to escape each level and
  avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans to inherit the children's
  fortune.
  .
  Inventions also take a big role in this game, and players will have to assemble
  them from common household objects. For example, in one level, Violet will be
  hunting for ice cream scoopers, soup cans, and a crank to invent an "apple
  chucker" which can help defeat Count Olaf's friends.
  .
  The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, with quest points and exotic
  books earned for discovering all the game's quirky secrets.

developer: Ubisoft

description:
  The gameplay is similar to that of Puzzle Bobble/Bust-A-Move, but with several
  key differences. There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the
  screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike
  Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that
  can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka.
  As with Worms, holding down the fire button increases the power behind the
  weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the
  bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an "arch",
  allowing players to reach difficult areas.
  .
  Shooting blocks will have one of two effects:
  .
  If you hit a block that is either the same colour as your bazooka missile, or is
  a rainbow block, that block and any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks
  connected to it will be destroyed. Any blocks that are not the same colour will
  not be affected; however, if the only thing holding those blocks up is the
  coloured blocks you have just destroyed, those blocks will fall into the water.
  .
  If you hit a block that is a different colour from your bazooka missile, or is a
  "dead block" - an uncoloured, grey block - it will be recoloured to match the
  missile.
  .
  (Weapons are affected differently by other blocks. This is covered further
  below.)

  Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique elements.  As the name implies,
  you have to kill your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks of keeping

game: Fortress
file: Fortress (USA, Europe).zip
developer: Majesco
publisher: Majesco
description:
  Fortress is a Tetris-variant puzzle game. As in that classic game, geometric
  pieces fall from the top of the screen and must be arranged in lines. Only
  instead of eliminating lines, the objective this time is to add them to the
  screen. The game starts with a timer (that counts a moment where neither player
  attack) and a castle gate falling between two flags (the opponent's flags can be
  seen to the left of the screen). Once placed, the remaining pieces are used to
  build a castle around it, as every 2x3 grid of pieces transforms into its walls.
  A grid of 8x3 pieces transforms into a wizard's tower that can summon a creature
  to attack the enemy castle.
  .
  Certain special blocks add features to the building: a cannon block places a
  shooting cannon that starts to attack automatically the opponent's fortress. A
  block with a window adds one to the building. Repairing peons come out of it to
  help fix the damage to the castle's walls. A block with a bomb adds a cannon
  that fires a peon towards the opponent's castle (an aiming reticule is shown
  over the enemy castle to help choose the right spot). Building walls around
  these special blocks prevent their destruction from the enemy attack. A monster
  appears randomly at the bottom of the screen to attack both players.
  .
  The player's goal at each level is to reach a number of score points before the
  opponent. The pieces can be maneuvered with the digital pad, and pressing UP on
  it makes them fall fast downwards. They can be rotated clockwise and
  anti-clockwise with the A and B buttons, respectively. Holding the R trigger
  allows the player to move the screen with the digital pad (for a full view of
  battle scene). When pressed, the L trigger destroys the top 3 rows of your
  castle and decreases the score.
  .
  The game has three game modes: tournament, battle and blitz. They vary in the
  amount of seconds on the timer and the goal score. There are four themes:
  pre-historic, medieval, pirate and space.

description:
  Bibi Blocksberg is the star of a German children's radio play and TV series. She
  is an apprentice witch, living in the common world of today, who has to live
  through different adventures.
  .
  The story: During a witch meeting, a lightning bolt struck and broke a crystal
  ball in seven parts, causing the witches to go mad. Bibi Blocksberg now has find
  all the parts to put them together and to restore the witches' mental health.
  .
  The game is an action-adventure. The seven levels, each corresponding to one
  witch and one part of the crystal ball, are full of monsters which hurt Bibi
  when she touches them. The health can be restored by finding sweets hidden in
  the level. Apart of monsters, there are persons which help her. In each level
  there is a magical item, often reachable only after getting through a little
  "game in game", that expands Bibi's magical powers, for example the broom that
  allows her to fly. The magic has to be used sparsely, because it costs magical
  energy, which can be recharged by finding little pulsating dots. This magical
  item is needed to get to the witch of the level, which Bibi has to fight. If she
  wins, the witch gets back to normal, gives her a part of the crystal ball and
  Bibi can go the the next level.
  .
  There also is a password system that allows the player to jump to different
  situations in the game, so that one does not have to play it through in one
  session.

  gold, which is used for currency, along the way. Klonoa once again utilizes his
  familiar weapon, the Wind Ring, but this time the "wind bullet" he can fire from
  it can be either blue or red. Guntz's handguns and Pango's bombs work the same
  way. Characters can acquire different weapons throughout the game. Likewise,
  each enemy in the game is given a color affinity of either blue or red, and
  Klonoa (or the other characters) can deal more damage to them by attacking with

  Lara is now in a "quasi-3D" overhead environment, as opposed to the
  2D-platformer view of the previous handheld (GBC) versions. This view proves
  helpful while Lara runs, jumps, shimmys, and shoots around. Although there is
  lack of a save feature, there is a password system which lets you restore back
  to 'almost' where you left.

developer: Ubisoft

description:
  The GBA version of the game, based on the film of the same name, has been turned
  into a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up. You assume the role of the young thief Jen.

  Destiny and she can performs basic attacks on the ground, as well as in the air,
  or perform more impressive moves such as mid-air double-jumps or flying kicks.

game: CT Special Forces
file: CT Special Forces (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl).zip
developer: Light & Shadow Productions (LSP)
publisher: Light & Shadow Productions (LSP)
description:
  CT Special Forces is a side scrolling platform shooter that has a superficial
  similarity to the games of the Metal Slug series. The player controls an
  operative of a counter-terrorist force on a mission around the globe to stop
  terrorist activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad moves the character,
  while the B button shoots the weapon and the A button makes the character jump.
  The character can't shoot downwards. The L trigger cycles through the inventory
  (displayed on the top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger throws
  grenades (when they are available). By selecting an ammunition type, the
  character uses the corresponding weapon (gas canisters for the flamethrower,
  machine gun pents for that weapon, etc). The default rifle has an infinite
  number of bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and a pair of handcuffs
  to arrest surrended enemies. Ammunition and health packs are scattered
  throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and assorted enemies.
  .
  The regular gameplay is occasionally broke by mini-games and entirely different
  sections: when the character collides with a reticule placard, the game switches
  to a first-person shooting gallery where the player has to shoot down a certain
  number of terrorists and rescue the hostages. When colliding with a parachute,
  two gauges with a red line on the middle appear on the screen. The one on the
  left measures the position of the falling character and the one on the right
  measures height. The character must be guided to the right spot, and the
  shooting button must be pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some mission
  stages change the game to a vertical shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar
  games, where the player controls a helicopter viewed from the top.
  .
  The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme: snow mountain, desert, jungle
  and a city. A password system is provided  (the password is displayed after the
  completion of every mission).

  Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become
  human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that
  must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.
  .
  The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top
  down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only
  have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped
  blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may
  be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the
  speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to
  destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up..
  Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be
  destroyed.

game: Island Xtreme Stunts

developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  Island Xtreme Stunts is a mixture of different genres in a single game. The
  player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format: ride a
  skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing
  stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as
  Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.
  .
  Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind
  the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running
  around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not
  offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to
  pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about
  what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the
  missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.

  released in Japan. The game can be easily compared to the game Pong, though it
  features many gameplay differences, graphical enhancements (despite the graphics
  themselves being deliberately primitive), and sounds.

  does. The goal is to keep the ball within the playing field. Allowing it to exit
  will result in a gameover. In all, there are five stages, each one containing
  different concepts though having the basic overall objective. For example, in
  the Wild Go Round you'll control a ball on a moving record. Because the record
  is moving, it'll alter the direction of the ball at pivotal moments, which will
  require the player to be quick on his feet and act appropriately. In all, the
  game's modes include Pool Flower, Box Juggling, Power Slide, Human League, and
  Wild Go Round. For players who wish to play multiplayer they can link with
  another Game Boy Advance with just a single cartridge. In multiplayer, all of

  control Lan – instead, you play as yourself.  Upon the game's first play, you

  can then choose your Net Navi (initially available for selection are Mega Man,
  Roll, GutsMan and NumberMan).
  .
  Unlike previous Battle Network games, you do not directly control your Net Navi.
  Instead, you can tell your Navi which enemy they should attack, as well as their
  attacking distance, and they will perform according to your directions.  You can
  also select to use  Battle Chips (from three which are randomly selected from
  your folder) by using the Control Pad to select the chip described at the bottom
  of the screen, then pressing A to use it.

  the Battle Chip Gate. This peripheral plugs into your Game Boy Advance, and

  Aiming and moving in cover and blind-fire modes is tricky, though. To gain the
  3-D effect, some detail gets sacrificed. Usually this is no problem, but
  occasionally you'll have a tough time recognizing an object. You move from area
  to area to engage a new group of enemies. You'll conveniently find crates for
  cover and barrels to help you pull off big explosions. Locking the enemy in your
  crosshairs, signified by your crosshairs turning red, doesn't guarantee a direct
  hit? The accuracy depends on the weapon of choice. A shotgun will normally
  provide a kill on the first shot. If you have an automatic rifle, your shots are
  relatively inaccurate even if your aim is true.

  EA Sports takes players back to the field with FIFA SOCCER 06 for the Game Boy
  Advance. Featuring nearly ever soccer team in existence and hundred of players,
  plus tweaks in game play and several new additions. Gamers will first notice the
  slight changes in controlling their teams. The passing and dribbling controls
  have been fine-tuned, allowing gamers to control nearly every aspect of the
  game. Each player has a strength rating that comes into effect when passing, as
  does the amount of weight players put behind the kick. A new shooting method,
  called the Optimized Shot Meter, requires more control and attention, as well.
  All of these realistic details make gamers feel like they're actually in the
  game and in control of everything. Manager mode now requires players to keep
  their club's budgets and handle purchases. Players have to decide how much to
  spend on staff, recruiting, stadium expenses, and other items. Then gamers have
  to decide if they want to sign with a sponsor to bring in extra income. All of
  this adds up to create a game that requires managers to really manage their
  team. FIFA SOCCER 06 contains all of the modes that made the previous FIFA
  SOCCER games great, including season, tournament, shoot-out, and verses modes.
  Soccer fans will enjoy playing against all of today's best soccer clubs
  throughout the season as they recruit, train, and guide their team to victory in

description:
  Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of
  the emperor penguins as they embark on a long journey to breed their young. The
  game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different gameplay. The
  penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate,
  find food, take care of the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all
  the way back.
  .
  A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins
  march on, players need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in
  a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and
  steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars
  and the penguins need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The
  penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they simply restart at the
  beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a
  group to succeed.
  .
  Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature
  mazes, or take place underwater where predators need to be avoided while
  collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds an new
  layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There
  is little time to pick it up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a
  warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.
  .
  Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more
  information about the penguin migration in provided in between levels.

developer: EA Sports BIG
publisher: EA Sports BIG
description:
  SSX Tricky is EA's follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than
  the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop
  between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more
  aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole
  new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a
  nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick,
  which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to
  play.
  .
  Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and
  Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts
  and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and
  Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The
  soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs.
  DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a "making of" segment.

  based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon,
  because the Invaders are back!
  .
  Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See
  Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito
  instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups
  and enemies.
  .
  You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the
  screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start
  at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and
  finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow),
  plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by
  shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game,
  there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if
  you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double
  shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a
  unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a
  reproduction of the original coin-op.

  carriers, over a kilometer long, carry all the hardware and weaponry of a
  Kilrathi-War-era carrier battle group. The first one, the Midway herself, is
  undergoing her shakedown cruise, with Blair along for the ride. Before this,
  though, the player is treated to a CGI video of a bizarre rupture in space in
  the Kilrah system: the first of the Nephilim invaders. The game's titular
  prophecy involves the coming of these alien invaders, who shall arrive only
  after "one who has the heart of a Kilrathi, but who is not Kilrathi-born,"
  conquers the felinoid warrior race.

description:
  This is the standard "Bowser has kidnapped the Princess, and Mario must rescue
  her" story. In this case, the Princess is transformed into a ball and launched
  from a Super Mario 64-style cannon, which a pair of goombas aim directly at
  Bowser's Castle. Mario is also transformed into a ball and chases after her.
  .
  There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of pinball tables. Each table has
  some exits (including the one below the flippers) that Mario can use to move to
  other tables. Also, each one holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all
  enemies on the table. Some exits require that Mario has a certain number of
  stars. To gain access to Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the bosses of the
  first 4 levels, which gives him star keys. The game also features a "Time
  Attack" mode, which allows players to fight already defeated bosses again.

game: Motocross Challenge
file: Motocross Challenge (USA) (Proto).zip
developer: DHG games
publisher: DHG games
description:
  Motocross Challenge is a 2D side-scrolling motorcycle game combining regular
  racing and tricks. The game can only be played through an emulator or a GBA
  flashcard but is not strictly homebrew. It is a game made by a commercial
  developer, but when the project was cancelled by two publishers, they decided to
  release the game for free. The game can also be ordered on a cartridge from the
  developer's website. In 2010 it was followed up with an iPhone/iPad release.
  .
  The tracks remind of Excitebike while the gameplay seems inspired by Motocross
  Maniacs. The game offers two main modes: Free Ride (choose an unlocked bike and
  track to practise) and Challenge. The Challenge mode involves a series of events
  in 3 major categories: Beat the Clock (time-based), Trick Attack (points-based)
  and World Tour (race against 3 AI opponents). When all courses are finished, the
  final event, MXC Championship, is unlocked. The events are divided over
  different trees and completing certain courses unlocks new tracks or one of the
  8 available bikes. The bikes have different statistics based on speed, handling,
  acceleration, height, boost and suspension.
  .
  Gameplay involves a fair amount of physics. When the bike accelerates, the front
  wheel leaves the ground and this needs to be compensated by nudging the d-pad.
  Up and down on the d-pad is used to switch lanes. Many tricks (activated through
  the L-button) involve balance and constant correcting is needed. Next to
  accelerating, braking and tricks, there is a button for boost. Only a limited
  amount is offered, but it constantly regenerates at a slow rate. It is used to
  gain extra speed, especially before big jumps to gain extra air time. The full
  amount of boost should never be used or let maxed out, as too little or too much
  slows the bike down. While in the air, using a combination of the L-button and
  the d-pad, players can perform tricks such as superman, nac-nac of backflip. By
  completing Trick Attack events, new tricks can be unlocked.
  .
  There are different types of tracks, set on a beach, an arena, downtown, in the
  snow, in a forest, in a desert and even a dump. They contain a series of jumps
  but also areas that slow down the bike, along with obstacles. The game screen
  shows the current position of the player (in World Tour), the current location
  on the track along with the finish, the time (remaining time in Beat the Clock),
  the current lap (in World Tour), the boost meter and the amount of points for a
  trick, and the remaining trick points needed (in Trick Attack). The game
  supports passwords to save and restore the player's progress.

developer: Eidos Interactive

description:
  In the GBA version of Bionicle Heroes, based on the LEGO Bionicle franchise,
  players take on the guise of the TOA Anika team. Set on the island of Voya Nui,
  they need to retrieve the Mask of Life, stolen by the Piraka race who also
  enslaved the Matoran, the native inhabitants, in the process. Unlike the console
  and the DS versions, a top-down perspective is used.
  .
  The game takes place on six zones of the island, followed by a final showdown.
  The player starts as a TOA of Fire, but by completing zones and killing the
  level boss, additional masks can be collected: Air, Stone, Ice, Earth and Water.
  Each TOA has a primary and secondary weapon based on the mask's elemental
  nature, with specific features. During the levels, there are also weapon
  upgrades to be found. The second weapon is limited by an energy meter which
  needs some time to recharge. Each zone requires a specific TOA guise, but in the
  Free Play mode completed levels can be revisited and players can then switch
  between the forms at any time to use different abilities. TOAs can strafe while
  fighting - there is an option to face enemies automatically or to control this
  manually.
  .
  TOAs are assisted by proto-spawn orbs, sidekicks that circle around the hero and
  fire at enemies. The orbs are chased off when they take too much damage, but
  they can also be upgraded based on the 6 elements and the weapons can be
  customized. Players can define to have the orbs fire in spread patterns or rapid
  bursts, lock on targets with fire, cause explosions, fire through shields or do
  double damage. Additional attacks are provided through elemental runes, which
  provide a one-time limited effect, such as freezing enemies, activating a
  lightning shield, smashing enemies with spikes from the ground, temporary
  invulnerability, full health and regeneration, and a fire blast.
  .
  By destroying objects and buildings in the environment, blue, gray or gold LEGO
  pieces are revealed, providing health and bonus points. The TOAs also need to
  use pieces to build bridges, platforms, elevators, turrets, barricades or moving
  platforms. At the end of each zone, the rank and score is shown. Based on the
  performance or specific actions, there are 12 medals to collect, of which a few
  can only be found in the Free Play mode.
  .
  Each zone contains secret cheat words. Upon discovering them, they are added to
  a cheat menu. They allow to play as a golden TOA or to obtain a new mask with a
  sombrero, open up a music jukebox, provide a hidden Cluck gun or grant
  invincibility or one-shot kills.

game: Mother 3
file: Mother 3 (Japan).zip
developer: Nintendo
publisher: Nintendo
description:
  The Nowhere Islands are an idyllic place; the residents of Tazmily Village live
  peacefully and in harmony with nature and with each other. But this changes when
  the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy and corrupt, with
  force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who
  must find out who wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn
  them into a high-tech nightmare.
  .
  Mother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character (the characters
  controlled by the player change often) travels around the Nowhere Islands with
  his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is possible to "dash",
  which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies
  out of the way (or to ram some objects/characters).
  .
  There are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based; each
  turn, a character can attack with his weapon, use a special ability (some
  characters have powerful psychic abilities, others have different special
  skills), use an item or try to run away. The battles feature a musical combo
  system, where tapping a button in rhythm with the background music will cause
  additional damage to the enemy. The characters have "rolling HP meters"; when
  they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP
  decreases slowly; this way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can
  survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the combat quickly.
  Winning battles gives the characters experience (and thus makes them stronger)
  and, later in the game, money (known as "DP"), which can be used in shops to buy
  better equipment or useful objects.
  .
  There are many frogs encountered throughout the game, who serve as save points
  (and later as ATM machines). If all characters die during a battle, you can come
  back to life near the latest save point encountered and try again.

  strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and
  obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship,
  which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if desired. By
  switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily
  gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave
  cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging
  explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around
  the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to
  overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling
  down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.
  .
  The fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9Ø Ragnarök; it
  was originally referred to as 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split
  into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force
  unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of
  the R-90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its
  Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R-9Ø2 Ragnarok II has the
  R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be
  charged through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original
  R-90 would simply be too powerful for the game to be any kind of challenge.

  The Princess has been kidnapped by King Koopa (again) and it's up to Mario and
  Luigi to save her (again). Not to be confused with the western Super Mario Bros.
  2, this sequel to Super Mario Bros. is very much an expansion to the original,
  with many reused graphics and concepts, though new ones are also present.
  .
  Instead of offering a two-player mode as in the original, this game allows you
  to choose between a Mario mode and a Luigi mode, with each character handling
  differently. Mario has tighter ground control, while Luigi has greater jumping
  capabilities.
  .
  Power-ups remain the same: Super Mushrooms grow a brother from small to Super
  size, Fire Flowers give them the ability to throw fireballs at enemies, Starman
  makes a character temporarily invincible, and a 1-Up Mushroom will give one more
  life. New to this game is a power-down, a Poison Mushroom which will harm you as
  if it were an enemy.
  .
  The goal is still to survive from the left side of the level to the right,
  avoiding perils and bopping enemies along the way, progressing through a series
  of 8 worlds with 4 levels each. That is, unless a warp zone is found allowing
  areas to be skipped. There are new tricks that work for and against the player,
  though. Some piranha plants will come out of their pipe even if you're standing
  right next to them, and bloobers now appear outside of the water. Wind can be
  present to alter how jumps will behave. Some warp zones will actually take the
  player to an earlier level instead of to a later one.

  NFL Blitz 20-02 is a game based on the American Football sport. As the whole

  limited control scheme of the system, the options on the field are less in

game: Fantastic 4
file: Fantastic 4 (USA).zip
developer: Activision
publisher: Activision
description:
  This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie "Fantastic 4". Unlike many licensed
  titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May
  Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally
  changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more
  content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the
  villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with
  Victor von Doom aka "Doctor Doom" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings
  in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet
  Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the
  heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that
  cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to
  achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail
  them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points,
  which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various
  bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in
  a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag
  team with a second player.

developer: Nintendo
publisher: Nintendo
description:
  The first portable incarnation of the Mario Party series, Mario Party Advance
  shakes things up quite a bit on the GBA.  With the focus on the single-player,
  there are all kinds of single-player mini-games, one giant single-player board
  to traverse instead of multiple ones (Shroom City), and all kinds of different
  Gaddgets and gameplay modes to indulge in.
  .
  The main single-player experience involves traveling across "Shroom City," which
  is a major departure from the standard set-up in past Mario Party titles.  You
  have the choice to be Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi, and depending on who you
  choose, you'll start at a different spot on the board, which is quite large.
  .
  You're given die rolls to navigate the board and, when you reach special
  sections of the map, complete special quests, which often involve helping
  residents of Shroom City and/or participating in special challenges.  Most
  quests involve collecting some sort of object elsewhere or a mini-game.  By
  completing these quests, you'll collect stars, which eventually allow for
  special boss bouts with Bowser, and you'll unlock mini-games and Gaddgets, which
  are simple, toy-like contraptions that you can play with.
  .
  The game ends when you complete your allotted number of turns, although
  additional turns and die rolls can be earned during the game by completing the
  "Mushroom Challenges" that occur rather often.  After completing your session,
  your rewards are saved, and you can play with your mini-games and Gaddgets in
  Play Mode.
  .
  There are also two additional modes available, "Party Land," where you can play
  special duel mini-games with a friend, and "Challenge Land," where you play
  through special modes that test your mini-game skills to earn coins, which can
  be used to purchase additional unlockables in a shop.
  .
  Finally, there is also a feature called the "Bonus Board."  You can play with a
  board that is included with the game using the GBA.  The GBA takes care of die
  rolls, mini-games, and end-of-the-game events.

  Gameplay is classic arcade, with one button to pass, another to juggle the ball
  and another to shoot. One of the key aspects is the "State of Grace"; by making
  fancy moves (such as overhead kicks, heel passes or heading the ball back and
  forth) and scoring goals, a power bar starts filling, and when it's full, all
  team attributes are maxed up and the players are given the ability to quickly
  run with the ball.

developer: Swing! Entertainment

description:
  What happens when you take classic puzzle gaming and toss in some of the most
  lovable characters in cartoon history? You get one undeniably awesome game.
  Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, and the rest of the TINY TOONS crew are ready for
  fun, and you're in the driver's seat. The basic premise of this addicting,
  original title is to arrange pairs of colored eggs, dropping them onto the
  screen to create combinations. Of course, there are numerous obstacles and
  would-be detractors to make things more difficult (UFOs, Tasmanian Devils), and
  time is never on your side. There are plenty of characters from the animated
  series along for the adventure including Hampton J. Pig and Fifi La Fume and
  each is prepared for puzzle-style battle. As many as four players can link up to
  see who has the quickest reflexes, and there are plenty of single-player modes
  to keep you busy as well. If you're a TINY TOONS fan, this one is a must-have.
  If you're not a fan well, you should be.

game: Monster! Bass Fishing

description:
  Although the name implies you're going to catch monsters, Monster! Bass Fishing
  is a normal fishing game where you can catch a variety of fish including various
  bass, northern pike, catfish, and more.  The "monster" part is that you get
  bonus points for catching monster-sized fish.
  .
  The game is played in one of two modes, Challenge or Free Fish.  In Free Fish,
  you can fish in any location that is unlocked for as long as you like.  In
  Challenge, you are competing in a tournament and will have a time limit and a
  specific location to fish at.
  .
  When you start at a location in either mode, you have the option to move your
  boat to any place on the map.  However, this does take time and may not always
  be in your best interest in the Challenge mode.  You can then either start
  casting, or you can change your lure first.
  .
  Catching fish is really just a matter of using a good lure and tempting
  movements.  When a fish strikes, you need to keep enough pressure on the line to
  keep the hook set, or the fish will get away.  If you let the line get too
  tight, the line will break and you'll lose the fish then as well.  Now just reel
  it in and see what you caught.
  .
  The GUI shows a nice fish finder that is color-coded by the type of fish that is
  seen.  Note that this finder is not always accurate.
  .
  Statistics for the game are very nice.  You can see a nice picture of your fish
  that you catch along with the size of it.  The top 6 can then be saved in the
  Aquarium for viewing at any time.  Your tournament scores will be based on
  weight of fish and any monster bonuses (bonuses for catching one of the top 3
  largest fish that round).  Winning the tournaments will unlock new locations and
  let you progress to a new location for the next tournament.  It will also get
  you a nice trophy.

  you to do charge attacks, parries, super moves and you win the game by depleting

  In Aggressive Inline the player takes the role of one of nine real-life skaters
  with one specific goal: receiving as much points as possible by performing
  spectacular stunts. Every of the 13 courses also has various special challenges,
  e.g. collecting or smashing certain items, which need to be performed to beat
  it. In contrast to the open areas of the console versions this one features more
  linear levels and tight time limits.

  It also replaces the "juice meter" with the so-called "grind meter" which is
  filled up by performing stunts. Every grind decreases this meter and if it is
  empty no grinds can be performed at all. Of course grinds are an elemental move
  to beat the challenges.\n
  There is also a freestyle playing mode where the player can unlock new
  skaters.\n

  involves a white one (more risk through double or nothing), a green one, and a
  red one (defense). The concept borrows some elements from poker dice with risk
  assessment based on retaining dice after the first throw. The gameplay involves
  different types of shots, but also penalties and foul cards (causing a player to

developer: Nintendo
publisher: Nintendo
description:
  Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the Dynasty
  Warriors franchise. Based on the "Three Kingdoms period" of ancient China,  it
  takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous
  government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually
  establishing three powerful kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of
  these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among one another, each trying
  to become the dominant power.
  .
  Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with
  a focus on action combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty Warriors
  titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing one of
  three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each
  character has their own unique storyline and missions. A briefing is given for
  each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the player to equip
  themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the
  designed number of spaces (determined by movement) around the "board". If an
  enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a top-down action fighting mode.
  Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another
  to unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged
  by successful attacking enemy units. The player's success against the enemy unit
  will determine the unit's "heath" and will be destroyed completely if all of
  it's units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy
  generals who have their own special moves and greater health. Many missions
  feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.

  Paintball professional Greg Hasting's returns in Activision's GREG HASTING'S
  TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for the Game Boy Advance, the sequel to GREG
  HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL. The second game in the series includes a number
  of paintball pros, different modes, and a level editor. Like the previous game,
  GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different
  gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either AI-controlled or with
  friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments.
  The single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in
  charge of forming a paintball team from a number of unknowns and turning them
  into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against big-name
  paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and,
  eventually, Greg Hasting himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new
  equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill points to increase
  their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows
  gamers to create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large,
  cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks, trees, picnic tables, and
  many other items to the field. Each map can be shared online or played with
  computer-controlled opponents. The ability to create and share custom levels
  online will keep players coming back to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL
  MAX'D for some time. It provides gamers with everything that makes paintball
  great without worrying about getting a ball of paint all over their faces.

  THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision's ever popular franchise.
  .
  The main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode.  When beginning a
  level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a
  feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're
  ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the
  goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to the previous
  games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this
  and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO
  while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular
  goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each
  skater, and is extremely hard.
  .
  All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve
  Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam
  Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa
  Steamer and Jamie Thomas.
  .
  The levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some of the levels include a college
  campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.
  .
  For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack
  to Horse and King Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo
  Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.
  .
  The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has
  online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one.  The
  PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder,
  which is not featured on any other version of the game.

  EA Sports returns to the slopes and the insanely fast-paced action of
  snowboarding with SSX 3 for the GBA. Combining racing with tricks, the game
  allows players to choose from different events and challenges as they desire.
  The story mode of SSX 3 involves, like the previous entries in the series,
  becoming the best snowboarder in the world. Players have a cast of characters to
  select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games. Once players have
  selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and
  performing huge tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can
  participate in. Players select the event they want to compete in from the map.
  There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something
  for everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to
  upgrade their equipment. In addition to winning the race, players want to look
  good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of them, and
  the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete
  enough tricks and the character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive
  tricks. Gamers who love snowboarding will enjoy SSX 3. While players can't
  explore as freely as they can in the console version of the game, the racing is
  still intense, and the many different game play options keep the game from
  getting boring or repetitive.

  There are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic.
  GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved
  tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the
  player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP
  courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the
  courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain
  and to master the act of "powersliding" on corners. The courses found in
  Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept
  locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed
  pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.

developer: DSI Games
publisher: DSI Games
description:
  Snood is a puzzle game based on a simple idea, of the kind that was commonplace
  in the late 1980s. The game is set out with a grid of small differently-coloured
  shapes, each featuring faces drawn on them. A succession of blocks are placed in
  an aiming device at the bottom of the screen, and you must rotate this so as to
  aim them, off the walls if necessary, to hit ones of the same colour.
  .
  When 3 or more of the same colour make contact, they are removed from the field
  of play. Any blocks which were only connected to those blocks (and not to any
  others or the ceiling) get removed from play as well. This is crucial, because
  each shot that fails to drop any blocks off causes a meter to move on one level.
  When this reaches the top, the line of blocks drops by one level. Once it
  reaches the point where blocks are moved down below the playing area, it is Game
  Over.
  .
  There are five skill levels, as well as a set of 50 challenge levels, and a
  Journey mode in which you play through one level from each difficulty. From
  medium difficulty upwards, you'll have to contend with Skulls among the layout -
  these can only be removed by being dropped away.

  The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game Face, which lets you customize
  everything and anything.  You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair
  and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other
  aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more.  You may
  also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs.  You
  also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and
  celebration animations, and "pissed off" animations for when you score a triple
  bogey.
  .
  One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week
  PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear.  You can play for up to
  twenty seasons.  The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an
  opponent's clubs if you beat them.  All the other standard game modes are here,
  from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice.
  .
  A new feature is the game's ability to read your console's internal clock, and
  provide you with game modes.  If it's near the end of October and your clock is
  properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items
  specific to that event.
  .
  All top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including
  Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard.  Newcomers to the sport have also been added,
  such as John Daly.

  Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real
  and fantasy.  One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult
  course located in Washington.
  .
  Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the
  EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports
  titles.  The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will
  increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver
  in Tiger Woods or historic teams in NHL 2004.  This feature isn't on the PC
  version.

  fall down. There are 365 puzzles in this mode (Daily Polarium) ranging from very
  easy to quite challenging.

  The Time Attack Mode requires you to solve either ten easy puzzles or five hard
  puzzles within the time given. Leaving a block of the wrong color in a line

description:
  The Dark Dragon was defeated by our hero in the first Shining Soul, and the
  people rejoiced as the Darkness faded away.  People are quick to forget,
  however.  As time passed, people's lives improved and they forgot about the
  Darkness.  But as the Light grew more and more powerful, it upset the balance
  between Light and Dark and soon Darkness was on the rise once again.
  .
  A prophet comes and warns the people of the impending dangers, but no one
  listens to him.  Although his crystal shows the upcoming dangers, the people
  pass by without any interest.  An agent of the Darkness, Gillespie, lures this
  prophet outside the city and kills him and shatters his crystal so the people
  remain ignorant of what is coming.
  .
  This same agent gives the "Forbidden Fruit" to Deatharte, the trusted adviser to
  King Marcel in Klantol Castle.  The adviser didn't trust Gillespie, but
  curiosity is a powerful force.
  .
  It is now up to another hero to take on the journey to once again stop this
  growing Darkness.  After choosing your character from 8 possible, you start out
  on his or her way to a tournament being held at Klantol castle.  On your way,
  you meet an adventurer who will explain how to battle.  Your journey then takes
  you to the castle to start the tournament.
  .
  This tournament is interrupted when the king finds out his daughter is missing.
  The king's adviser heads out to find her, and the king asks that you go as well.
  It is here that your story really begins.
  .
  The gameplay is similar to most RPGs of this type where the monsters are fought
  in real-time.  An interesting part of this game is that your resistances will
  increase when used.  Outside the castle, you can stand on a fire that will not
  damage your HP, but as your resistance reacts to the fire, it will increase
  slowly.  Traps will also increase your resistance if you are hit by them, though
  you will also be hurt.  Only the one fire is safe.
  .
  Take on many monsters, cast spells, get new equipment.  But most of all, save
  the world from Darkness.

  points to qualify for the Challenge Mode. Once the player has enough points,

developer: Zoo Digital Publishing
publisher: Zoo Digital Publishing
description:
  This handheld racing game offers a range of licensed cars, several courses and
  circuits, and a challenging set of opponents. To these stock elements, it adds
  one more: weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you,
  or slow him down with a missile.
  .
  With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize
  yourself with tracks or choose a Championship Mode to progress through a series
  of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money you've
  earned (either by placing or picking up money icons during the race) to repair
  and -- if possible -- upgrade your car. The upgrades can improve your car as a
  racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g.
  adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).
  .
  The track design uses the isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind
  an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require
  you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of
  faith.

  choose from any of the 29 NBA teams in the league, each having several key
  players to take control of during the action...more than 140 superstars in all.
  Each professional in the game has his own playing attributes, from ball handling
  to dunking styles, so if you're looking to strut your stuff on the courts, it's
  best to know which players are the ones to grab. The game features the series'
  trademark alley-oops and skypasses, as well as the always-extreme "on fire" mode
  that's activated when a player sinks three baskets in a row. The game only fouls
  on Goaltending, so make sure you're not snagging the ball when it's coming
  down...
