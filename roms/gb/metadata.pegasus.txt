    Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games
    held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the
    console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles,
    pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and
    archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics,
    or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events,
    and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow
    competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.
    .
    Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes
    compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two
    qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction
    can earn world record times.
    .
    Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely
    pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then
    set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests,
    three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex
    pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and
    good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round
    composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where
    they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition
    continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.
    .
    The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping
    events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed
    by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight
    allowed three more attempts.
    .
    Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the
    goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of
    the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to
    the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards
    and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed
    directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal
    is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for
    each.

    One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he
    started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle.
    As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly
    tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind
    those earthquakes.
    .
    Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either
    Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's
    universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.
    .
    Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for
    instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The
    task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures
    matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.
    .
    After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with
    the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will
    receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters
    would like to receive that hammer.
    .
    Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie
    access to the last puzzle and character.

    and Maxie is in the cellar. The goal is to reach said penthouse by solving a
    number of levels by finding the exit. Those levels are side-scrolling in nature,
    but there is also some vertical movement involved. Regarding gameplay, there are
    no specialities: the player jumps over platforms and dodges traps and enemies in
    order to avoid losing life energy. Getting hit too often results in losing a
    life. The only way to destroy enemies is to hit them with Maxie's tail and power
    ups grant either an extra life, a tail upgrade (range) or bonus points.

    “Eddie's Puzzle Time” is an unreleased puzzle game that was submitted to us by
    Jason McGann, who has given us permission to share it with you. The game was
    meant for the GameBoy, so you will need to run an emulator on your computer to
    play it.\n
    The game is retro and rather straight forward with easy-to-play elements. There
    are three starting points with each having its own set of levels to play
    through. The object is to “throw” like-numbered blocks into each other before
    your timer runs out on each level. It was an easy feeling to jump into this
    right away and start playing. Some levels are challenging, but if you work
    through some of the tricks they are all solvable.\n
    According to Jason, it was about 99% completed with most of the features.
    Passwords have not been finalized.\n
    Jason McGann Design credits titles like  Alfred Chicken, as well as Programming
    GTA: Vice City Stories, and GTA:Liberty City Stories from RockStar Leeds.
    Currently he has formed The Great Unwashed with Jeff Tawney.

    platform jumping and banana collecting remaining a core part of the game

    Gundam, Kamen Rider V3 and Ultraman Taro are the main representatives of the
    'heroes' side of the six teams in Battle Dodge Ball, with Zeong, Ikadevil and
    Zetton rounding out as the villains.
    .
    The general gist of the game is that you can choose one of the six teams. You
    then fight each of the other five teams once per round in a short dodgeball
    game, two-on-two. Unlike normal dodgeball, you are not knocked out with a single
    hit. Rather, in Battle Dodge Ball, each character has a specific amount of HP.
    Once he takes enough hits to lose all his HP, he is out of the match.
    .
    Along with HP, this trends into a general statistics system with several other
    stats. If you win a match, you gain a variable amount of experience points, and
    15 experience points if you lose a match. You can level up your stats and make
    each match significantly easier over time.
    .
    Your team has two players each. The Leader has the ability to make special
    attacks, and is generally more powerful. The follower, however, has two 'forms'
    or copies or whatever - an infielder who plays on the main arena, and an
    outfielder who stands on the lines behind the enemy side of the arena and can
    catch long passes and grab balls that enemies dodge. The outfielder can also
    return balls to you, but also throw it at the enemy players, making him
    potentially dangerous. Stats for the outfielder are upgraded separately from his
    infield counterpart.
    .
    Once you play a full 10 rounds against each of the five opposing teams, the game
    ends.

    it is possible to do a "super shot" which is strong enough to send the goalie
    into the net along with the puck.

    Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two
    players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also

    lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

    tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is
    totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the

    symbols. When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the
    frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit.

    In the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called
    special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get
    hidden by "?" blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed.
    Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level
    really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level)
    and credit (gives a second try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to
    be activated manually; credits is applied automatically. Besides the regular
    playing mode, there is also the "Brain Race" available which involves solving a

    God Medicine: Fantasy Sekai no Tanjou is a role-playing video game for the Game
    Boy. The game was released by Konami in 1993, only in Japan. The game was

    called God Medicine Hukkokuban.
    .
    A video gaming company was to release Phantom, their new RPG, but the company
    mysteriously is destroyed. Noah, Ken, and Miki are three RPG fans that are
    disappointed by this. Wandering about, they stumble upon a shack with a great
    demon inside, battling three warriors. The warriors are defeated and the demon
    exits through a portal. The warriors give their souls and powers to the three
    RPG fans, who now must enter Phantom to save the game's world. However, they
    must also protect the real world from the demon.
    .
    God Medicine features standard RPG elements. The three characters can level up
    through battle and equip weapons and armor. Spells can be learned, as well as
    Maphu attacks. After the party collects Maphu gems and gains the special Maphu
    weapons, they can put the gems in the weapons. Each gem has a different effect
    depending on what character equips it. Some Maphu attacks need to be charged
    during battle first. The charges last even if the battle is finished. The player
    can save anytime, except in battle.

  description:
    Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing, as the name implies, is a boxing game featuring
    the three-time World Heavyweight Champion. The game display 2D sprite-drawn
    boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called "FreeCam" 3D system), with the boxers moving
    around the ring in 360°.
    .
    One or two players can choose the number of rounds (up to 15), the round length
    (up to 5 minutes), the number of times a fighter must be taken down to be T.K.O.
    and the number of referee counts (up to 10). There are two game modes:
    exhibition (which can be played against the computer or one-on-one by two
    players) and the tournament mode (single player). Players can choose among nine
    fictional fighters plus Muhammad Ali himself.
    .
    There are two control types: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the
    d-pad moves the boxer around, while the A button is used for jabs, the B button
    for defense and the C button for hard punches. In this mode, the game decides
    which of the boxer's arms will be used for each punch. In the simulation mode,
    the d-pad moves the player around. By holding the A button (for the left arm) or
    C button (for the right arm), the player can perform head jabs (by pressing up
    in the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body hooks (by pressing left) and
    body hooks (by pressing right). Holding the B button, the player can cover up
    (by pressing up), duck (by pressing down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway
    right (by pressing right). By pressing A and B together, the boxer performs an
    uppercut.
    .
    Each fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they get tired by fighting or get
    hurt, the bars decrease. The lower the bars, the slower or weaker the punches
    get, until the boxer is knocked down. By defending himself a boxer can regain
    power or speed. There's also a counter of punches landed at each side of the
    screen. If the fight ends with no winner, the judges decision is made by those
    numbers alone, regardless of how many times the fighters were taken down during
    the fight.
    .
    The game features digitized speech, including samples of Ali's voice.

    specific way. Max can punch and kick enemies, and also use environmental hazards
    to damage them; pushing enemies into water or luring them into traps will kill
    them. Some areas require Max to jump on moving platforms, climb ropes, swim,
    avoid falling into lava or deadly spikes, etc. Max can collect treasure on each
    level, bananas or watermelon slices to heal himself, and special items to unlock
    barriers.

  developer: Meldac

  description:
    Mercenary Force is an unconventional shoot'em up set in Japan's Edo period and
    inspired by Japanese history and mythology. When Japan is invaded by the minions
    of a dark lord, the shogun sets out to hire the best warriors in the land to
    combat the enemy.
    .
    Players start with 5000 yen and must begin by hiring their mercenaries. The team
    has four slots and can be recruited from five different character types
    (servant, ninja, monk, samurai and mystic) in any combination (including more
    than one of any character). The characters differ in hiring price, starting
    health, weapons (amount of projectiles, speed and direction), and their special
    attack.
    .
    The game consists of six levels, seen from an angled top-down/side-view
    perspective, with the screen scrolling automatically to the right. The
    mercenaries must shoot hordes of enemies to get to the next level, including
    several bosses. The mercenaries can change their formation between four
    different options: a vertical line, a diamond shape, a square shape and a
    horizontal arrowhead formation. It is also possible to switch the character in
    the lead position, leading to a large variety of tactical options. The hit
    points of each team member are counted individually, so if one is killed the
    remaining ones can fight on. Besides their standard weapon, each character also
    has a special suicide attack, triggered by pressing both buttons at the same
    time. These are usually highly devastating attacks, but the monk's power
    actually allows the group to skip ahead through a large part of the level.
    .
    Killed enemies drop coins of 10 yen in value that disappear after a short while
    if not picked up. The money reserve is used in a matter of ways: between stages,
    new recruits can be hired to replace fallen fighters. There are also various
    buildings in the levels that allow the spending of money. Cafes offer various
    items that restore or increase health and, in some levels, can change the
    character class of the team leader. There is a fortune-reading at a temple which
    makes it possible to recruit a hidden character, and the possibility to
    resurrect fallen comrades at a daibutsu. Only temples don't cost money and offer
    healing for free.

    names, but with teams, stats and schedules based on the 1995 NFL season. Both
    the new expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville as well as rule changes like
    the two-point conversion are incorporated.
    .
    Game modes have been cut down from the predecessor: the only remaining ones are
    exhibition, season and playoffs. In addition to the 30 regular teams, there is
    an All-Madden team for use in exhibition games only. Most features from the
    predecessor make a return: selectable game length (20, 40 or 60 minutes), freely
    definable audibles, timeouts, and detailed stats. The playbook has been
    reworked, substitutions are now available for all positions and the game
    features quarterback speech for the first time.

    Game perspective (top-down, vertically scrolling) and controls are mostly

    .
    Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel
    around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called
    upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions
    include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater
    explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater
    property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it.
    The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles.
    Underwater is a dangerous place.

    The vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel
    designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards,
    move up & down and change orientation between facing left and facing right\n
    Stinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows
    you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.\n
    Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is
    the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can
    pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear
    debris and a retractable drill\n
    Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's
    orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which
    may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for
    transport\n
    Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple
    weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects.
    It can also activate switches\n
    Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps
    the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However
    Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable.
    Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can

    Kitchen Panic is a whimsical 2D platformer starring a potato. An army of cans

    Each sprawling level is designed for both exploration and speed, as in each

    Potato has a unique special ability to aid him: he can spin in mid-air like a
    certain hedgehog, and use the force to launch himself further and faster than he
    can run. A forward spin will launch him forward, and a backspin will launch him
    straight upward. This greatly aids in exploration of each stage, allowing for
    very long or high jumps. There are also a number of power-ups to be found,
    including Ice Potato and Rocket Potato.
    .
    The game is made up of a number of zones, each with six stages. At the end of
    each zone, Potato must face off against a food-themed boss enemy, such as a
    stack of plates or a giant ice cream cone.

    The iteration of the Chessmaster series on the PlayStation 2 contains most of
    the features available in the corresponding PC game - which, in this case, is
    Chessmaster 9000. You can play training games (with all the hints and analysis
    tools available), rated games (your rating changes after each play), puzzles
    (chess ones, not the "build the picture" type), learn chess by browsing through
    the hundreds of tutorials available in the Pandolfini's Chess School or watch
    famous games.
    .
    There are, however, some new features in the PS2 version; the most useful one is
    the Online mode. Other is the "living world" of the Chessmaster Championships,
    where the AI's rating changes, too, as they play each other. The last one is
    more spectacular - a  fantasy-themed - orcs vs. humans - game mode with animated
    chess sets and a 3D environment. You get to play chess in a forest, inside a
    castle and in the desert.

    European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a
    sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European
    pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much
    more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of
    advances in programming skill.
    .
    The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games,
    but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot,
    so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one
    exaggerating the effect.
    .
    As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total
    score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent),
    there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as
    possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.

    Loosely based on the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II sees Virgo the
    Carpathian appear in New York city. He captures Diana's baby and it is up to the
    Ghostbusters to get him back. In order to accomplish this, the Ghostbusters:
    Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through the courtrooms, the
    sewers, the apartments, the underground and the art museum.
    .
    Ghostbusters II is a top-view action game based off of New Ghostbusters II (the
    second Ghostbusters II license on NES) but with enough differences to be unique.
    Players begin by choosing two of the four ghostbusters, who all play the exact
    same. The first one selected is controlled by the player directly and carries a
    proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the first and carries the ghost
    trap. The objective of each level is to capture a predefined number of ghosts
    before the timer expires. The player moves up, down, left and right. One button
    will fire the proton gun directly in front of the first ghostbuster, stunning
    any ghosts. The second button will toss the trap directly in front of the second
    ghostbuster, trapping any stunned ghosts. While exploring the levels, any of the
    2 remaining ghostbusters (as well as the ghostbusters' accountant Louis) not
    currently being used will occasionally show up. Touching them will provide
    power-ups (and often swap with a selected Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns,
    instant traps and invulnerability.

    This game was released only in Japan.\n
    The scenario is a maze and the player controls Popeye who has a time limit to
    collect some hearts, find Olive Oyl and save Swee'Pea which only appears
    somewhere to be saved after the hearts were collected and Olive found.\n
    Popeye should avoid Bluto in order to prevent a fight with him, not losing time.
    When the fight is inevitable, and if Olive is already found, Popeye will lose
    her, and after the fight ends, he has to find her again. Bluto can drop weapons
    and enemies such as cannons and animals. He also steals the hearts and when it
    happens the heart will appear somewhere else to be collected. J. Wellington
    Wimpy is always wandering around and puts hamburgers that eventually block
    Popeye's path, however he can put so much as remove by eating them. A "flying"
    can of spinach will sometimes appear during the game anytime and out of nowhere,
    and can be used to increase Popeye's strength: be faster and the ability to
    eliminate enemies released by Bluto and Wimpy's hamburgers that obstruct the
    path. There are three playable courses and each one has five stages. In the game
    ending, Popeye gets married to Olive Oyl in front of a church.\n
    Bluto is a playable character in the multiplayer-mode.

    Your four puppies need to be rescued and brought back to their mom. As a

    to drop down just when you pass underneath, and careless skateboarders. You can

    situation - shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the vicinity.

    easy task. While your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own accord when you
    put him down, you'll still have to carry it over obstacles, and you'll be forced

    Muddy Mole's wife and seven kids have been kidnapped by the evil farmer, Jinbei!
    It's up to you to help Muddy solve the many puzzles of Jinbei Land.  Snatch all

    create your own secret underground paths.  A word of warning, however - Jinbei
    has got his best goons guarding your family, so you'd better watch out!
    .
    Mole Mania plays from an overhead perspective.  Although in each room you have
    to destroy all the foes to progress, the game is much more puzzle-oriented than
    it is towards action.  It is quite common in later levels to get yourself
    'stuck', which can be fixed by leaving and returning to the screen to reset the
    puzzle.  One of the game's clever 'hooks' is that players can dig underground in
    each stage to find a completely different map than they do above ground, which
    can be used to get through otherwise impassable terrain.
    .
    The game also features a two player mode, where one player is Muddy, and the
    other is Jinbei.  Muddy must swipe as many cabbages as possible, and Jinbei must
    stop him.  At the end of the round, players swap roles, and then the player who
    got the most cabbages wins.

    party of 4 from the same character classes. During gameplay special
    side-characters will join you in battle to help defeat certain enemies.
    .
    The other improvement is in strategy. In FFL you gain experience points after
    each battle, increasing strength, etc. In FFLII, you gain different points and
    abilities depending on how you defeated the enemy. If you win by using a sword,
    your strength increases. If you use magic, your mana increases. This adds a more
    strategic approach to defeating enemies.

    based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon,

    Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see
    Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from
    Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many
    power-ups and enemies.

    You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the
    screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start
    at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and
    finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow),
    plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by
    shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game,
    there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if

    Like many of Ocean's games Navy Seals was licensed from a film of the same name,
    by Orion. You control a succession of the USA's elite fighters with the aim of
    destroying missiles held by terrorists. You must work your way through levels
    and find the exit to get to the next level. At the beginning and end of each
    level, there is a cut scene which consists of a still image with text, to
    progress the story of the game.
    .
    You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up
    improved weapons as the game goes on. The gameplay is fairly standard platform
    work, seen in many other Ocean movie tie-ins.
    .
    The Game Boy version of this game differs from the home computer version
    released around the same time. The level layout is different, there are no
    ladders ladders or ropes and you don't have to place bombs. This is possibly due
    to technical or game pack memory limitations of the Game Boy.

    Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives
    the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal
    with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the
    screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The
    available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and
    the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.
    .
    The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by,
    scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge
    systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.

  description:
    The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world
    governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a
    dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in
    football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual
    presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts
    introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a
    market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.
    .
    Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in
    each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how
    good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides
    can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer
    operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges
    quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set
    pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and
    then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be
    selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these
    combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders,
    midfielders and strikers cover.

    Lingo is a digital version of the TV game show of the same name. Like in the
    game show it is the objective to guess five letter words. You are only given the
    first letter.
    .
    You get several tries and with each try the letters are marked which are
    correctly placed and those who appear in the word but at a different location.
    Within words you get to blindly draw a ball from a pool.
    .
    .
    There are 17 numbered balls that correspond with a numbers on a bingo card.
    There's a ball with a question mark that let the players pick a number at will.
    When the players complete a row or column they receive bonus points.
    .
    .
    There's also three red balls that passes the turn to the other player and three
    green balls. A green ball allows you to pick another ball and also when you get
    three green balls before the game is over you win a jackpot. The game starts
    with two players, but after some rounds the player with most points goes to the
    finale. The game is in Dutch so only features Dutch words. It contains a library
    of 15,000 words. There's also options for six and seven letter games. It is
    officially licensed by the Dutch iteration of the game show and thus includes
    the Dutch TV presenter François Boulangé.

    the way to the next level. Of course there are various hazards to overcome,
    mostly in the form of special platforms like sticky or angled ones. There are
    also other tools to collect which can be used to make life easier at other

    realize the great evil they have awoken: their city was built upon the grave of
    the ancient sorcerer-emperor Harugisu.

    World Bowling is a bowling game in which the player has to beat bowling alleys
    from six different countries (England, China, Japan, Canada, France, USA). To
    win the game, all alleys have to be beaten in a row with an increasing points
    requirement (200 to 250) - if the score is missed once, it is back to the
    beginning.
    .
    The player can set the weight of the bowling ball: a heavier ball has more power
    but this goes in turn with a loss of control. It also depends on the chosen
    player character: the male is better with heavy balls while the female character
    should use a lighter one. The throw itself is divided into three parts:
    character position on the alley, control and power. While the first is simply
    chosen by lining the character up, the latter two are reaction games: a marker
    goes from left to right (and vice versa) and the player has to hit the button
    when the marker reaches the desired point. A high value (i.e. the marker is
    right) in control means that the throw is straight while a high power determines
    the speed and strength.

    pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has
    no tile next to it on at least one side.
    .
    This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and
    features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten
    minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.

    más tarde a Game Boy. Como la versión original, este título no salió de Japón,
    saliendo a la venta el 22 de diciembre de 1993. Nos encontramos ante un muy buen
    beat'em up encuadrado en esta gran saga. Más que con una secuela de nos
    encontramos con un spin-off, porque en lugar de situarse en un instituto japonés
    la acción pasa a desarrollarse en el Japón feudal, pero el estilo se mantiene.
    Esto significa que estamos ante un "yo contra el barrio" poco convencional al
    tener un gran énfasis en la historia y un desarrollo no lineal, pudiendo desde
    un principio avanzar por donde queramos, tanto yendo a la izquierda como a la
    derecha, eso sí, siempre repartiendo mamporros.

    To solve the mazes you must transform the items which are found in the maze into
    something more useful. For example, a piece of iron turns in a glass key when
    dropped in a pool of fire. Thus, if you want to pass a glass door, you have to
    find a pool of fire and a piece of iron. These transformations are not random,
    but sometimes require multiple stages. If you keep good notes, you'll find out
    all possible transformations.
    .
    The make it all a little bit more interesting, there are monsters inhibiting the
    maze. That problem is easily solved by transforming something into a decent
    weapon.

    from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In contrast to the
    other versions of the game he has weapons to his disposal, e.g. a throwing
    knife. Other differences are a unique level design and another health system:

    bring peace back to the planet.

    The Heroine has a special ability: she can talk to the demons you meet in random
    battles and persuade them to join your party. You can store those demons,
    collect them, and summon them in battles. Demons are divided into various races
    and species. Otherwise, the game uses a standard turn-based combat with physical

  game: Super Robot Taisen
  file: Super Robot Taisen (Japan).zip
  developer: Banpresto
  publisher: Banpresto
  description:
    The very first installment of the Super Robot Taisen series is quite different
    from all of its successors; most notably, the robots are treated as sentient
    organisms, and all pilots are absent from the game. As the intro tells, they
    live on the planet of super robots, when a mysterious space creature know as Gil
    Gil Gan takes control of most the planet's inhabitants and launch a destructive
    war.
    .
    The basic interface is like every other SRT game: your robots are placed out on
    a map grid with different terrain types. Placing the cursor above a robot and
    pushing a button brings up a menu with basic choices for movement, attack,
    status and special options. A similar menu is displayed if you move your robot
    close to an enemy unit, offering options to attack, use spiritual powers or
    negotiate. After all robots have moved, the turn is over, and the game switches
    to the enemy phase.
    .
    All robots are licensed from two parties only ? Sunrise and Dynamic ? and when
    starting the game you may choose to start with the Gundam team, the Mazinger
    team or the Getter Robo team. One robot must be designated as the team leader,
    which allows you to upgrade its statistics with a number of points. If the
    leader robot is destroyed in battle, the game is over. Unlike later games,
    destroyed units are not repaired after a scenario is cleared, but may show up as
    an enemy unit later on. This puts a lot more emphasis on the negotiation command
    than later games, since a lot more enemy units may in fact turn out to be
    friends. Few of them will listen unless you have first brought down their HP to
    a minimal amount, though.
    .
    Apart from HP, each unit has XP. Experience is gained for each enemy unit that
    is destroyed, and a level up adds to all aspects of your robot; speed, force,
    armor, HP and SP. SP, or spiritual power, is like MP in conventional RPGs,
    allowing a unit-specific set of ?spiritual commands? to be executed. These
    usually change game variables, such as force of attack, speed of dodging or
    health. Health is otherwise regenerated by putting a unit in one of the bases
    spread out on each map. When first entering a base, you gain a power-up item.
    These are fitted to your robots between scenarios and include new weapons and
    shields.
    .
    Each battle is displayed as a small animation, but it is all very primitive
    compared to later games in the series, even on the Game Boy, with little
    movement apart from the bullets and lasers. Preceding each battle you have
    initiated yourself, you may choose your weapon. Weapons may be hand-to-hand or
    ranged. Ranged weapons are advantageous since your opponent may not fire back ?
    this is true even of enemy units which possess ranged weapons of their own. All
    weapons have also properties for their accuracy and power, which are altered
    according to the terrain and whether enemies are at sea, on the ground or
    airborne.

    .
    You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply
    go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the
    occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different
    background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In
    addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode;
    indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets;
    crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby
    space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty
    of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers,
    Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.
    .
    There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and
    weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert
    or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the
    standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and
    hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat,
    Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.
    .
    The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is
    to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot
    directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....
    .
    Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone,
    you'll find the option of "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.

    Thanks to the Maita Flower, Trip World is at peace. It is being protected by an
    old Shabubu, a member of a race of bunny-like beings. The flower grows on the
    holy mountain known as Mount Dubious. However, one day the old Shabubu is
    attacked and the Maita Flower is stolen. Trip World becomes disarranged and its
    inhabitants don't stop quarreling with each other. But there is one hope in the
    form of the old Shabubu's grandson, Yacopu (also spelled Yakopoo).
    .
    The player controls Yacopu through five stages in this side-scrolling
    platformer. The young Shabubu's trademark ability is to shapeshift into
    different forms. In his normal form, he is able to walk and jump as well as to
    kick enemies, Yacopu's primary way of attacking. Unlike in many other
    platformers, many of the enemies don't harm you on contact and push your
    character around instead. However, certain foes might attack you after you
    damaged them, while others do so from the beginning.
    .
    At almost any time, the player can change to the flying or fish form. Flying
    Yacopu is able to reach places he wouldn't otherwise be able to, while the fishy
    hero is best suited for underwater areas. You also come across power-ups that
    temporarily give your character new powers, such as stunning enemies with seeds,
    bouncing around as a ball, or attacking with an extended tail. Beneath the
    mountain, settings in the game include a jungle, the ocean, and a castle. In
    each stages, you have to defeat a boss at the end. Eventually, you will
    encounter the one who stole the Maita Flower. The flower must be retrieved in
    order to save peace in Trip World.

    a certain amount of gold, which can be used to buy power-ups (called "panels" in

    example, to revive Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase the length
    of an explosion. Before entering a new area, the player chooses which panels to
    use in order to complete the area.

    The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player modes. In "Panel mode", each
    player can place only one bomb at a time and the bombs' radius starts at one,

    planet. In order to leave it, it needs to find one energy field per level. The
    biggest problem is how the ship is built: two round cockpits connected with a
    stiff rod. One of the cockpits is always fixed while the other one can be
    rotated around it. By alternating between the two cockpits the ship moves around
    the level, but of course this makes it harder to navigate tight passages. There
    are useful power-ups to collect like a compass and obstacles which should not be
    touched. Each level has to be solved within a time limit and there is no
    restricted number of lives.

  game: Cave Noire

  developer: Konami
  publisher: Konami
  description:
    Cave Noire is a roguelike. The game evolves around four quests (killing
    monsters, freeing fairies or collecting gold/orbs) with ten difficulties each.
    The difficulty determines how big the target number is, the stats the player
    starts with and what monsters are encountered. Starting a quest creates a
    randomly generated dungeon where the player has one chance to reach the goal -
    death means a new dungeon has to be created. Beating a difficultly level unlocks
    the next; this is also the one thing the game saves.
    .
    The dungeons itself are shown from a top-down perspective and feature the hero,
    walls, floor tiles, monsters and items to collect. Movement is turn-based and
    each turn is divided into four phases (player movement, player attack, monster
    attack and finally monster movement). Attacks are only possible when the two
    participants stand besides each other and the computer simply calculates the
    result from the statistics (attack, defense, luck and a a random component)
    which then lowers the health points of the attacked hero/monster. Of course
    reaching a health of zero means defeat. The mentioned statistics can be improved
    by finding and using certain items like weapons or armor. Potions, spells and
    rings which have additional effects when used/equipped, e.g. health
    refreshments, healing poison, dealing much damage or invisibility.
    .
    Important to note is that the environment also plays an important part in the
    quest. The walls and tiles may have special effects when touched, examples are
    pits (the player/monster falls to the next level of the dungeon and takes
    damage), breakable walls, lava or teleporters. Some rooms may be covered in fog
    which obscure the floor tiles until the hero walks onto it (monsters still can
    be made out). There is a specific kind of monster which clears the whole room
    when killed - but at the same time another one has the exact opposite effect.

    To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate
    direction and distance where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to
    shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the level rise in the power bar.
    When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you
    release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you
    stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the
    bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy
    bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line. Too much to the left
    of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls to
    the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the
    course proves to be too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us

  description:
    This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic
    industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial
    artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional  Toho
    lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The
    game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode,
    which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of
    scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the
    player has completed the Normal mode.
    .
    The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through
    five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against
    two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to
    complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the
    player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against
    different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player
    only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.
    .
    The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations
    of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal "punch-kick" scheme
    is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For
    example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters
    have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a
    move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.

    Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the
    wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To
    get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your

    hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength
    from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he
    gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will
    burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

  description:
    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade differs from the two other games with the
    same name as it is a hybrid of various genres such as platform action,
    motorcycle racing, puzzle solving and even some adventure elements.
    .
    In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you play Indy's role in his search for the
    Holy Grail, but this time it is you who chooses which step he will take at each
    part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about
    the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a
    telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship
    called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what
    you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go
    to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.
    .
    In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to
    different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres.
    For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have
    to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle.
    Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch,

    You can play simple exhibition matches or tournaments, or launch into a career
    mode. In this you start at the bottom of the world rankings, and must reach the
    top by beating the game's players, who other than George are all fictitious
    boxers with varying strengths and weaknesses. The coach gives advice before each
    fight to help highlight weaknesses in your play. There are passwords for each

  description:
    Undercover Cops: Gaiden: Hakaishin Garumaa is based on Irem's Undercover Cops
    arcade game. But whereas that title was a beat-em-up, Hakaishin Garumaa instead
    takes place as a turn-based board game RPG. Similar in design to the later Mario
    Party titles, players begin by choosing one of three of the undercover cops. The
    player begins at the start location of the board and must use one of their
    "numbered value tiles". If the number chosen is above 1, the player must compete
    on a slot machine to try to win a value up to what was written on the tile.
    Following that, the player is able to move the number value, which they have
    won, of spaces on the board. Certain squares will activate events that include
    talking with characters, buying items and engaging in battle.
    .
    Battles with enemies are handled by each side choosing one of the numbered tiles
    they own. The party with the higher number becomes the attacker and the lower
    value becomes the defender. Each side then chooses another numbered tile to
    determine the amount of "effort" put into the attack or defense as well as a
    position of the body to attack/defend. With that chosen, the turn's sequence
    plays out, with HP lost on a successful impact. Upon defeating an opponent in
    battle, the player gains XP and gold.

    Mario Land 3, special agents from the Black Sugar Gang of Kitchen Island sneak

    back what you now call your own.

    In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain
    point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected
    along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For
    example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and
    floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he
    return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and
    each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable,
    or they can halt your progress.

    Super Chase H.Q. is an enhanced sequel to Chase H.Q. As usual, you must drive
    your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some
    crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped
    with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.
    .
    But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about.
    You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as
    cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent
    flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.
    .
    Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own.
    When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you
    if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have
    different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a
    missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your
    indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply
    when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out
    of time, the game ends.
    .
    When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are
    awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the
    number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the
    game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which

    Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay
    of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.
    .
    Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging
    mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky,
    Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch
    from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.
    .
    Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four
    Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and
    Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600,
    progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as
    the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after
    Ms. Pac-Man again.
    .
    Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous
    intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms.
    Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".

    to stand on pillars, but those randomly rise and fall. Hugo can move in four
    directions.\n
    The fifth level is unlocked after beating the other four.\n

    Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game.  There are varying modes of
    play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play
    is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks,
    either horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks
    in-between are then removed from play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall
    into the bin that contain any two of the following types:
    .
    Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it.
    Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or
    vertically, and they will be cleared.  The more stars you clear, the higher the
    score.
    .
    Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster,
    Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match
    two of each to clear them from the screen.  Any Star Blocks between the two
    character blocks will also be cleared.
    .
    Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb
    will explode, removing all blocks in the same row.
    .
    Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen.
    Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be
    removed in the normal way.
    .
    The game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks
    which then clear other blocks.  If you clear two or more blocks in this manner,
    then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can
    fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even
    further.

    enter your pet in Race, Beauty and Knowledge tournaments.  You can increase your
    chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make sure that when you
    enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it
    could.  Win a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame.

  game: Wario Land : Super Mario Land 3
  file: Wario Land - Super Mario Land 3 (World).zip
  developer: Nintendo
  publisher: Nintendo
  description:
    Wario, Mario's greedy rival from Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, is more
    determined than ever to get a castle after being booted out of Mario's.  He has
    heard that the pirates of Kitchen Island have a golden Statue of Princess
    Toadstool that's worth a king's ransom!  Wario figures that if he swipes the
    Princess' statue for himself, as well as all the other loot the pirates have
    hoarded, he'll have more than enough cash for a castle that's even bigger and
    better than Mario's!
    .
    Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 is different from previous games in the series in
    that you control the brutish and greedy Wario.  Even when small, Wario can break
    most bricks with a punch, and some enemies are so weak to him that they'll just
    be pushed aside!  Wario has a body slam attack that he can use to destroy
    enemies, and he can also pick them up and throw them at his foes.  If that
    wasn't enough, there are three different power ups that Wario can find. The Bull
    Hat lets him plough through bricks in a single hit, ram his horns into the
    ceiling to hold onto it, and butt stomp to stun all enemies.  The Jet Hat allows
    him to fly horizontally for a short period of time, and increases his jump
    height and speed.  Finally, the Dragon Hat allows him to breathe a long stream
    of fire for a short period of time.
    .
    To suit Wario's greedy nature, the game revolves around money.  Throughout the
    stages, you can earn coins by grabbing them floating in the air, punching them
    out of bricks, or by body slamming into foes and then collecting the coins they
    drop.  You can also find hidden treasures buried deep within some levels by
    finding a key and then throwing it at the skull door to unlock it.  Once Wario
    reaches the end of a level, he usually needs to pay a toll to get the
    end-of-level door to open.  Pressing Up on the Control Pad and B pulls out a
    coin worth 10 coins, which you must throw at the door.  Once the door opens, you
    can exit and the level is complete.  Before you finish each level, you can
    choose to play a mini-game that doubles or halves the amount of coins you have,
    with a 50/50 chance.  You get three tries, and can choose to leave whenever you
    wish...so don't get too greedy!

  description:
    The Real Ghostbusters, known as Garfield Labyrinth in Europe and Mickey Mouse
    IV: Mahou no Labyrinth in Japan, is a puzzle/platform game. The story is very
    simple: Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or Mickey and Mini Mouse, depending on the
    version you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile breaks loose and
    Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre
    labyrinth, which Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must escape. There's no other goal
    apart from that, the player just needs to find the exit in each level. Apart
    from getting there, the exit must also be unlocked. For the latter, the player
    must collect all gems in the level.
    .
    Each level contains various traps and enemies which need to be avoided. The
    puzzles involve finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make use of
    teleporters and especially: drilling away blocks. Conveniently, the player finds
    a pneumatic hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be used to create
    paths to certain areas and items, without blocking the way forth or back.
    There's also an inventory to store items like keys and bombs (used to kill
    enemies). The protagonist has a health bar and can take several hits before
    losing a life, but there is also a time limit for each level.
    .
    The game features a password system, a password is given automatically after
    completing a level.
    .
    In spite of the differences in main character and a minor variation in the short
    intro cinematic all regional versions are identical.

    fighter and has to solve various missions, e.g. destroying an enemy base or
    destroying all enemy aircraft in the area. However, despite the name this is

    to deflect enemy missiles) - to kill opposing forces. The game is played from a
    first-person view and the cockpit offers information like a radar and the fuel,
    which has to refilled when running out.

    Batman Forever is the officially licensed game based on the 1995 movie. The bad
    guys this time around are the Riddler and Two-Face.
    .
    This game is a hybrid of side-scrolling platformer and one-on-one fighter. The
    player makes way through levels that include some platform jumping elements, but
    take on opponents one at a time like in a fighting game. The player's arsenal
    includes a lot of nifty bat-gadgets (one has to be chosen before the level
    starts) and a collection of fighting moves that are unleashed with special
    button combinations. In contrast to the console/DOS version, there are no
    puzzles to solve.

  developer: Ocean

  description:
    The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based
    on the second animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams
    family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and
    Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion,
    e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the
    usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a
    lot and avoiding enemies.
    .
    This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams
    Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost
    identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is
    that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional
    power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.

    This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a

    You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all
    the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of
    the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors
    into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving
    you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them
    too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and
    the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making
    the Newtonian physics more complex.

  game: Head On
  file: Power Racer (USA).zip
  developer: Tecmo
  publisher: Tecmo
  description:
    Power Racer is a conversion of the arcade game Head On that includes an extra
    special mode. The normal mode is a faithful recreation of the original: the
    playing field consists of a square race track with four lanes. Between the
    corners the lanes are partly interrupted so the lane can be changed. This is
    needed because on the uninterrupted parts there are dots which all have to be
    picked up to progress to the next level. There is also another (on higher levels
    two) car on the track which tries to crash into the player - of course this
    needs to be avoided. This mode features ten difficulty levels.
    .
    The special mode adds a few things to the basic playing principle. In this mode
    there are three difficulty levels and nine tracks which all add variations to
    the playing field, e.g. a different lane layout, oil slicks which cause the car
    to spin when driving over it or conveyor belts. There are also a few power ups
    which randomly appear on the track and need to be picked up within a limited
    time frame. Most of them are not activated instantly and can be used at a
    opportune time. The power ups are a bomb (causes a near enemy to spin), a level
    skip, an extra live, a shield, an enemy slow down and one which causes all cars
    to make a u-turn. This mode can be played by two human players.

    That's right, the jelly bean-loving Blob and his faithful Earth-boy companion
    are back in a brand-new adventure! This time out, the duo's exploits take them
    to the Royal Castle of Blobolonia, Blob's home planet, as they attempt to free
    the lovely-and imprisoned-Princess Blobette from the clutches of the treacherous
    Antagonistic Alchemist.
    .
    Join our heroes as they encounter secret rooms, clever traps, and dangerous
    obstacles in the labyrinthine depths of the castle. But all is not lost-these
    two share a very special secret: With each flavor of jelly bean the boy feeds
    Blob, Blob will magically transform into a different shape that can help this
    intrepid pair get past just about anything the Alchemist can conjure up!
    .
    The Rescue of Princess Blobette tells the story of a young, male protagonist and
    his blob companion as they attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the
    titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the
    Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the
    planet Blobolinia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on
    Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the
    player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is
    controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and
    floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and
    forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in
    contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents.
    However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly
    beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For
    example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a
    trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may
    also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding
    five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.

    While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand
    Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'état. His way to the throne lies through the
    Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she
    refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the
    dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on
    his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.
    .
    Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of
    the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run
    mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels,
    emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping
    technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters'
    movements.
    .
    The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and
    environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis),
    and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite
    amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he
    dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three
    units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or
    permanently increased with large jars.
    .
    The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and
    new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and

    with Kirby as the ball.  In the game you have to help Kirby defeat King Dedede
    and the three bosses who each guard one of the Pinball Lands.
    .
    The game is divided into three tables or Pinball Lands, each consisting of four
    screens, three ordinary screens, and a boss screen  If you fall off the bottom
    of the lowest one, you lose a life, unless you press A at the right moment to
    activate the springboard, which becomes harder each time.  Each screen has a
    variety of things to do.  The middle screen will give access to some sort of
    bonus game, where you must try to get as many points as you can, and can add to
    your bonus and bonus multiplier.  The bonus is added to your score when you lose
    a life, as in ordinary pinball.
    .
    The aim is to defeat each boss.  To get to the boss you must perform a task on
    the top ordinary screen.  The bosses themselves must be defeated by firing Kirby
    at them, but they will try to stop you, sometimes by temporarily de-activating
    one or both of the flippers.  If you defeat the boss on each table, you face
    Kind Dedede himself.

  description:
    This is a platform game based on the movie "Home Alone". Kevin's family went on
    vacation, but they forgot about him, so now he's home alone. Now there are two
    burglars who want to break into the house.\n
    Kevin has to prevent the burglars from kidnapping him, by riddling the house
    with traps.
    .
    The player controls Kevin through the mansion in a side perspective. He has one
    hour before the burglars will break into the house. In this hour, the player has
    to set up various traps in order to make the burglars give up on capturing
    Kevin.\n
    After this hour, the burglars break in, and the traps become active.\n
    Each trap deals 5 damage to a burglar, and the first shot of Kevin's BB gun
    deals another 5. During this phase, the screen always tells in which room each
    burglar is at the moment. The game is won by dealing 50 damage to each burglar.

  game: Elevator Action

  developer: Taito
  publisher: Taito
  description:
    You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret
    documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the
    basement of the building.
    .
    Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only
    one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which
    Agent 17 can kill them:\n
    Shooting them with his gun.\n
    Kicking them by jumping onto them.\n
    Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto
    one of them.\n
    Crushing them with an elevator.\n
    Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period
    of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways
    that are already dark.
    .
    While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up
    or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a
    bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will
    move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is
    able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as
    possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an
    elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall.
    .
    Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are
    the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or
    down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.
    .
    Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents.
    If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot
    escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the
    documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.
    .
    If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and
    he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react.
    Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses
    a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may
    also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for
    Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an
    elevator.

    distributor, Mani (although his name does not appear on the cart), along with at
    least one other, which contained Taito games. Presumably this was their official
    attempt to compete with the pirate multicarts flooding the market, but given
    that you hardly ever see one of these and pirates are everywhere, it seems to
    have had minimal success. It's interesting that Mani made it in China, since all

    enters the temple and breaks the casket, Zakdos is set free and murders all that
    are left of the clan of Colin except for a young boy named Mute. To make things
    worse, the Sword of Hope, that has sealed away an evil dragon, is also stolen.

    characters, must stop Zakdos and retrieve the Sword of Hope before the dragon
    awakens.

    than controlling only prince Theo. Apart from that, both games play very

    or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the
    possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the

    levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing
    a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression
    sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.
    .
    Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his
    bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out
    for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and
    stray bombs.

  description:
    Ishido is a solitaire board game played with tiles (like Shanghai).  The
    objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest
    possible score by following specific rules of play.  It is a solitaire game.
    There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the
    game very strategic in nature.  Additionally, when desired, the player can get
    an oracle reading by asking a question...the question is answered when the
    player makes a very elegant play (4 way match).
    .
    There is also a "construction set" where players can create their own tiles and
    backgrounds.  But the game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.

  developer: SETA Corporation
  publisher: SETA Corporation
  description:
    In Q Billion, you play a mouse which must level out a playfield filled with
    stacks of tiles. To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a
    taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles
    stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each
    other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have
    something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single
    tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three
    tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a
    stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack
    and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create
    a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than
    one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a
    lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese
    puzzles pioneered by Sokoban.
    .
    Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares
    or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be
    eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for
    three-dimensional ? or even four-dimensional ? thinking on behalf of the player.
    None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be
    cleared.
    .
    A second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a
    limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create
    levels of his own.

    turns the fruits in his knapsack into living fruit monsters.  Unknowingly, she
    drops a magic ball which agrees to help Spanky out on his quest.
    .
    The object of the game is to get through all six of the towers which consist of
    10 levels as well as a boss battle.  In order to proceed to the next level, you
    must acquire the amount of keys the locked door requires.  Keys are found lying
    around until a monster picks them up in which case you must use your ball on
    them to get it.  The ball has for different attacks: baseball, soccer ball,
    volleyball and basketball.  In order to attain a stronger ball, the ball must be
    bounced on Spankey's head.  Spanky also gets different hats which give him a
    specific power until he loses it or the level ends.

  developer: Nintendo

  description:
    Prince Richard and Prince Sablé have been rivals since they were young.  When
    news arrives of a princess in a far-off kingdom who requires rescuing, Richard
    dashes off in the hopes of saving her before Sablé manages to.  Left to catch
    up, Sablé explores the land, and soon becomes cursed, turning into a frog
    whenever a strange bell is heard.  Sablé must remove the curse and rescue the
    princess.
    .
    Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru is an action-adventure game.  The game plays in
    two modes: a top-down view (where most exploration and battle is done), and a
    side-scrolling view (where more puzzle solving is done than battles).  Battling
    is not actually performed by the player, instead it is all automatic.  If you
    bump into an enemy, you will see a dust cloud appear, and the pair will scuffle,
    with each character's health draining.  Whoever loses all their health first
    loses the battle.  Sablé can increase his battle advantage by collecting heart
    containers (to increase his life bar), and power ups that increase statistics
    like power and defense.
    .
    Another feature of Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru is Sablé's ability to transform
    into a frog at certain points in the game.  This allows him to access areas that
    he previously could not.  The main goal of the game is to conquer a huge castle,
    however, sections are sealed off until you complete parts of the story, allowing
    you to explore it in small parts at a time.

  description:
    The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant
    plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their
    own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus
    and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10
    levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman
    from the 12 pieces.
    .
    Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in
    use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is
    perhaps the best option for first-time players.
    .
    The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards)
    and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to
    produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various
    methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who
    can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their
    exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any
    combination of skills and experiment.
    .
    Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible,
    rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60
    Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe -
    Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the
    hope of saving more Lems.
    .
    Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you
    have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your
    progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

    As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until
    eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep
    under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength
    of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of

    hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the
    top to the bottom of the screen.  Defense consists of trying to guess which

    octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them.

    Fire: Position your net to catch the falling people jumping from the burning
    building.  The "Modern" version has Mario and Luigi rescuing Toad, Yoshi and
    Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess Peach's Castle.  Each falling character has
    different weights and falling patterns.
    .
    Manhole: The player must cover the holes to keep the continually walking people
    from falling through the manholes and into the sewers.  In the "Modern" version,
    Yoshi must use his tongue to keep Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. from falling
    thought the hole, each character having different speeds and patterns.
    .
    Oil Panic: The player must collect the dripping blobs of oil before they slip
    past and ruin everything.  The "Modern" version has Bowser dropping oil blobs at
    Mario, who has to catch the oil and dump it over to Yoshi before the Koopa King
    gets the best of Mario.
    .
    Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two difficulties: Easy and Hard.  The higher
    score a player gets in each version, new unlockable bonuses will become
    available via the "Gallery Corner".  These bonuses include release dates,

    Nemesis is the first entry in the long-running Gradius series on the Game Boy.
    Its side-scrolling shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely.
    Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in
    earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave
    level (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a
    Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC
    Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the
    classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.
    .
    The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance
    the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item.
    The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots,
    lasers, option satellites and forcefields.
    .
    The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the
    number of lives to a maximum of 99.

  description:
    Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the
    same story as it's later counterpart - however the level design was massively
    changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the
    GameBoy Color version.
    .
    To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect
    various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or
    Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers,
    collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels
    like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans
    again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the
    game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels
    additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the
    difficulty of the game can be adjusted.
    .
    There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books
    of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at
    the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you
    have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the
    plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland
    you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in
    Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the
    desired trophy!

    Sailor Moon was a video game released for the Nintendo Game Boy by Angel Studios
    in 1992. It was one of the first Sailor Moon-related video games to be released.
    .
    In this game, the player controlled Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. The storyline was
    based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime.
    Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game
    Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).
    .
    The three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through
    the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking
    to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of
    level in which she fought numerous enemies.
    .
    By default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the "down"
    button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the
    wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop
    special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon
    Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short
    amount of time, etc.\n
    The bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually
    had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of
    the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.

    Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

    Levels that take place entirely under water.

    Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a
    plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.
    .
    .
    Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons.
    After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will
    appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can
    use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons
    ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons
    that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over
    time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy
    decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the
    standard weapon, he loses a life.

  description:
    Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG
    genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a
    knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike
    roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must
    approach the monster and "bump" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same
    time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the
    exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to
    escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game
    is randomized.
    .
    .
    .
    The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power
    stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points
    (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the
    amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast
    magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example
    breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.

  game: Peke to Poko no Daruman Busters
  file: Peke to Poko no Daruman Busters (Japan).zip
  description:
    El objetivo del juego es sencillo: derrotar al monstruo y salvar a la chica. El
    método principal para hacerlo es disparar bloques. Los bloques pueden ser
    disparados por ambos personajes: el personaje de la izquierda se controla con B,
    y el de la derecha con A, y puedes mover los personajes de arriba abajo con el
    D-Pad para cambiar su altura. (Sin embargo, se mueven de forma sincronizada, por
    lo que no puedes cubrir varios niveles). Los bloques disparados irán en línea
    recta por el campo de juego hasta que choquen con un monstruo o con otro bloque.
    (Las columnas más a la derecha y más a la izquierda siempre estarán llenas de
    bloques, lo que te da un suministro ilimitado). Si se golpea un bloque, el
    bloque al que se disparó ocupará su lugar, y el bloque que estaba allí se moverá
    un espacio en la dirección del disparo.  Entonces, ¿cómo se puede derrotar al
    monstruo? Es bastante sencillo: hay que eliminar los bloques para que el
    monstruo toque el suelo, y se eliminan los bloques emparejándolos por parejas.
    No importa si las parejas se hacen vertical u horizontalmente, siempre que no
    sean diagonales. Una vez que el monstruo toca el suelo, se destruye; una vez que
    se destruyen todos, se gana el nivel y se pasa al siguiente.

    Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms,
    aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit
    points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes,
    causing damage to everyone around.
    .
    Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from
    his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time
    limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses
    health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or
    offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player
    can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn
    ends.
    .
    There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is
    affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others
    include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and
    girders.
    .
    There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land
    and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the
    ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.

    Mega Man 3 is a traditional side-scrolling platformer: you jump from brick to
    brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all
    respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get
    a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely
    walking.
    .
    Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when
    you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top
    of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to
    turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and
    he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like
    the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the
    water (you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover
    beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities
    function just like boss weapons.
    .
    When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least
    a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single
    power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but
    superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter.
    There are eight of these, corresponding to the eight main levels, even though
    there are twenty-one levels in the entire game.
    .
    Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also
    collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your
    health. You start the game with three lives. Other features include Surprise
    Boxes lying around for you to find. There are infinite continues and a password
    feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.

    Battle of Kingdom is a Japan-exclusive strategy/board game.\n
    The object is to lead a kingdom through various battles using the format of a
    traditional board game.\n
    In order to advance to the next battle, players must destroy at least 92% of the
    monsters on the battlefield.\n
    Each stage represents a battle in a high fantasy campaign to save the world from
    an unknown evil force (that resides in a skull castle). As players progresses to
    the right side of the screen killing monsters from the enemy forces, the
    probability of winning the entire battle shows up in percentage. Players are
    unable to automatically attack the opponent if the number of points on the
    attack power meter becomes depleted. Attacking manually does not deduct attack
    points from the player's statistics, however.\n
    Monsters like slimes can face off against each other for control of the playing
    field in the lower levels of the game,\n
    while players are allowed in the upper levels of the game to summon the King's
    loyal army of archers, knights, horsemen and magicians. Even the leader of each
    respective kingdom is expected to fight. All these creatures must be bought in
    card form before being allowed to join the battlefield. The player's creatures
    can either fight, run away from battle, or cast a magic spell. All creatures
    have hit points, attack points, and special points.

    the board game):\n
    Mr. X, a fixture on England's "Most Wanted" list, is on the run in London. Will
    Scotland Yard find and capture him before time runs out?
    .
    The main map shows 199 stations in the city that can be reached by taxi, bus or
    underground. Each type of transportation costs a ticket.\n
    One player takes the part of Mr. X and slinks around the city, leaving clues for
    the others, who are the Scotland Yard detective team. If Mr. X manages to escape
    capture, he/she wins. All the detectives see is which travel ticket Mr. X used
    during that turn. The detectives must plan movement routes to surround Mr. X and
    try to cut off his lines of escape. To make things difficult for the detectives,
    they only have a limited number of tickets, and when they run out of a ticket
    type, they cannot use that mode of transport anymore.
    .
    .
    As a bonus, you can choose to play the "computer enhanced" version, which
    purports to add RPG elements such as money, weapons, fighting, health and
    conversation.\n
    The players can visit the stations and interact with people or locations.\n
    Detectives have to catch criminals in order to earn money so they can buy
    information about Mr. X.\n
    Mr. X has to find specific items in order to win. He can rob people or houses to
    earn money. Weapons, tickets and other helpful things can be bought at different
    locations. A lot of people offer information for a price. Only a gang boss of a
    district can sell Mr. X pricey information about the quest item. But to find the
    gang boss you need to buy information about his whereabouts first.
    .
    Overall, Scotland Yard is a game that emphasises logical deductions and
    strategic planning over luck. You can play either as Mr. X or detective, solo
    against the computer or with friends.

    multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander
    around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls.
    On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these
    discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while

    distributor, Mani (although his name does not appear on the cart), along with at
    least one other, which contained Taito games. Presumably this was their official
    attempt to compete with the pirate multicarts flooding the market, but given
    that you hardly ever see one of these and pirates are everywhere, it seems to
    have had minimal success. It's interesting that Mani made it in China, since all

    of each level however, is picking up a certain number of hostages and taking
    them to your home base.

    This thing here is not so strange - it's a licensed multicart, made only for the
    Chinese market, with four Tomy games on it: Ganbaruga, Raijinou, Zoids and
    Miracle Adventure of Esparks. It was actually released by Nintendo's Hong Kong
    distributor, Mani (although his name does not appear on the cart), along with at
    least one other, which contained Taito games. Presumably this was their official
    attempt to compete with the pirate multicarts flooding the market, but given
    that you hardly ever see one of these and pirates are everywhere, it seems to
    have had minimal success. It's interesting that Mani made it in China, since all
    licensed Game Boy games from other regions were made by Nintendo in Japan.

    Soldam is a puzzle game where the goal is to match soldam fruits along an entire
    row.  The fruits drop down from the top in a 2x2 square which can be rotated. If
    the edge pieces match color, all of the fruits in the direction of the matching
    edge pieces will change their color to match.  Matching edge pieces can be made
    horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    .
    Combinations can be made if the color of more than two of the same edge pieces
    match. Once an entire row of fruits match, it will be cleared and the fruits
    that didn't match will drop. However, as time played in each stage progresses,
    the top of the board will begin to drop.  If a fruit reaches the top of the
    board, the game will end.
    .
    Some game pieces that help to clear the board. Along the right side of the
    screen is the word "extra".  Occasionally, a letter from that word will drop. If
    all of the letters are on the board, a pixie will appear to clear multiple
    fruits from the board.
    .
    However, some pieces hinder the ability to clear the board.  A "sekiero" piece
    will occasionally drop, which takes up all four spaces in the square.  In order
    to clear the sekiero, the entirety of both of the horizontal rows around the
    sekiero must match.  If a stage goes on for too long, an enemy will appear to
    occasionally throw bombs which change the color of the fruits and impede
    progress.

    A stage is cleared when all of the fruits have been cleared from the board.

    will also need their own game cartridge. Single players can enjoy a quick pickup
    game by selecting an unofficial game of 1 to 9 innings. An official game will
    allow a victorious team to move on to consecutive matches against progressively
    more challenging teams, a feature that substitutes for the traditional 'Season
    Mode' of most baseball titles. But you'll have to do this in a single sitting as

    Play in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in the gameplay or learn how to

    Both word games are one player.
    .
    The first of the word games is Bible Word Match, sort of a Bible-word-themed
    version of the Milton Bradley board game Memory. Words are randomly selected
    from the Bible and hidden in pairs on the screen. Move the flashing box to a
    hidden word and press A. The word will be revealed. Now move to another hidden
    word and press A. If the two words match, you gain ten points and the words will
    disappear from the screen. If they do not match, you lose five points and the
    words will be covered again. After three correct matches in a row, a cherry will
    appear. Capture it to get a thirty point bonus. After five correct matches in a
    row, a Boom will appear. Capture it to reveal all words briefly.
    .
    The other word game is Bible Shepherd, a Bible-themed version of Hangman.  You
    have three sheep in a pen, the alphabet to select from and a word who's letters
    are hidden, showing only blank spaces. Move your cursor to a letter and press A.
    If the letter is not in the word, the sheep will stop moving. Select an
    incorrect letter again and one of the sheep will jump out of the pen. If you
    select a correct letter, its location(s) will be revealed in the word and, if
    you have sheep outside the pen, one will jump back in. You get one hundred
    points for each correct guessed word plus ten points for any sheep in the pen
    when the word is guessed correctly. If all three sheep jump from the pen before
    you can reveal the word, you lose.

  game: NBA All Star Challenge 2
  file: NBA All-Star Challenge 2 (USA, Europe).zip
  developer: LJN
  publisher: LJN
  description:
    NBA All-Star Challenge 2 is a basketball game with six mini games, mostly based
    on real-life one-on-one variants. The main differences to the predecessor are
    the new mini game Slam Dunk (replaces H.O.R.S.E.) and slightly reworked graphics
    for the others. Before each game, the player can choose between 27 real-life
    athletes, one from each NBA team's 1991 roster. All games can be played by two
    players via the Game Boy link cable.
    .
    The disciplines are:\n
    One On One: A standard one-on-one match which is restricted to the area directly
    before the basket. The winning condition can be set before starting the match:
    either scoring a certain amount of points or scoring the most within a certain
    time frame.
    .
    Free Throws: This mini game is about a free throw, i.e. trying to score from a
    fixed place without getting disturbed by an opponent. A cursor automatically
    moves around the basket and when the player presses the button, the athlete
    throws the ball to the cursor's position. The number of throws can be set before
    the game.
    .
    Three Point Shootout: There are five marked points around the basket; directly
    at the border where scoring rewards three points. The athlete stands at each
    point for a certain amount of time before he switches to the next point. A
    throwing attempt is simply performed by pressing the button twice: first for
    jumping and the second time for throwing the ball. This mini game is available
    in a training and a competitive variant.
    .
    Slam Dunk: Before each round, the player selects the performed dunk variant from
    a list. This mode is shown from the side, the player moves towards the basket
    and has to press the right button with the correct timing to score. This mode is
    available in a training (the game gives a few pointers for the timing) and a
    competitive mode.
    .
    Accuracy Shootout: Works similar to Three Point Shootout with the difference
    that the points are spread all over the area. The player needs to walk to the
    spot and, if the previous shot was missed, collect the ball from the place it
    bounced to. The player can either set the points manually before the mini game
    starts or use the random generator.
    .
    Tournament: A series of one-on-one matches in knock-out mode.

    mountains, mines and more. Also ride storks, mine carts and logs to defeat
    Gargamel and his minions and to rescue the missing smurfs.
    .
    On each level you must collect five stars in order to get access to the bonus
    level. (You don't have to collect the five stars in order to get through the
    main level) On the bonus level, try to collect as many bonuses as possible
    before the time runs out. There are three bonus levels: "The Dam", "The
    Mushrooms" and "The Butterflies".

    'fire'. If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated,
    as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits
    a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit
    when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the

    other features more enemies. The levels themselves are a mix between the levels
    featured in the PC-88 and NES versions.
    .
    The game itself is a puzzle game in which the player controls a mole who has to
    push a blue stone on an specially marked place. The stone can only be pushed,
    but not pulled. While Flappy does not care about gravity, the blue and red
    stones do: they fall down if pushed off an edge. This has to be used to clear a
    path for the blue stone and to crush enemies which try to hurt Flappy. Touching
    them or being crushed by a stone results in the loss of a life.

    Earth's gravitation. You must also keep an eye on your compressor, since it must
    be constantly at a high level for the rockets to boost sufficiently. Feeding the
    compressor too much will deplete your fuel, though, so everything must be

  description:
    PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and
    technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic
    courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are
    in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of
    the console allow).
    .
    The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were
    digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive,
    driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match
    and Shootout), as well as a replay.
    .
    Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to
    start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's
    possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and
    pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a
    bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit
    areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in
    pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However,
    only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice
    levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.

    Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate

    in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage.
    Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the
    machine guns, and are shot to be collected.
    .
    T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general
    concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns
    down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a
    besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy
    supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time
    to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet
    research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend

  description:
    Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack
    is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.
    .
    The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which
    can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as
    possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at
    random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you
    place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area,
    he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of
    blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a
    meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear

    the blocks that were on top of them will drop.
    .
    Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human
    player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of
    ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.
    .
    The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have
    to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in
    certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction
    with the press of a button.
    .
    All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the
    versus mode.

    Different from the NES game of the same name. In the game the player takes on
    the role of the legendary Prince Valiant licensed from the cartoon series of the
    same name which is in turn based on the comic series Prince Valiant. Prince
    Valiant must lead Arthur's armies against the Tyrant Cynan. The goal is to
    capture all his castles or defeat all his armies.

    Tiles are either white or gray depending on whether Arthur or Cynan controls it.

    Characters on the map can be directly controlled after being selected. This
    happens in a top-down view similar to The Legend of Zelda. Characters can attack
    and jump. Each character has different attacks. Items can be collected and the
    player can move freely between tiles. Moving through tiles that are occupied by
    the enemy conquers those territories, but the enemy can take them back at any
    time by moving through them again. If two enemy units meet on the same tile,
    combat ensues. In real time the player must try to defeat the AI opponent. This
    is done through dodging his attack and trying to land a blow. To conquer a
    castle all enemies including those in adjacent tiles must be defeated.
    .
    It is also possible to find and collect items in the direct control mode. Items
    serve as power-ups that for example make the player faster or restore health
    points.The player can return to a castle at any time to heal completely.

    The player can select the size of the world to increase or decrease the game's
    length. Additionally he or she and change the difficulty of the AI player
    (Cynan) and select a handicap for himself. It is also possible to play against

    According to African legend, a human baby was abandoned in the forest. Found and
    brought up by a she-ape named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of the jungle and
    the language of the beasts. Years later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he
    was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he
    occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle.
    .
    Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife,
    Lady Jane Greystoke, but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of
    the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into retrieving the seven gemstones
    that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be the
    Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been
    given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the
    tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther.
    .
    After consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the
    Rainbow have been scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps.
    Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and
    treacherous quicksand.
    .
    Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find
    each gemstone. Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes,
    spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with
    any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer
    shrinks accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to escape
    them.
    .
    If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver
    them to Usanga, Jane will be released. If not, she will become nothing more than
    another bowl of jungle soup.

  description:
    The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to manoeuvre a selection of blocks
    into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of
    the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right,
    which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.
    .
    There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms
    meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular
    order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd
    number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of
    the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making
    contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also
    encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level
    arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a
    certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example).
    .
    The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four
    levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an
    expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on
    level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220
    screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a
    level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an
    impossible position) loses one of your three lives.

    pushing Start accesses your item inventory.

    Your goal, is to cut out parts of the wall with your beam, causing them to fall
    on the enemies below. You should be careful not to cut out too big of a piece;
    otherwise you'll find yourself not having any usable pieces of the wall later on
    in the level. It can be very easy to do so without noticing.

    If an enemy reaches the top of the building, touching it will cause you to lose
    a turn. It'll either start to crawl towards one side of the screen, or keep

  game: Wheel of Fortune
  file: Wheel of Fortune (USA).zip
  developer: GameTek
  publisher: GameTek
  description:
    Wheel of Fortune is based on the popular game show produced by Merv Griffin.
    The goal is the same as the game show, which is to guess missing letters to
    solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects as found on the show, such as
    place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the players spin the
    wheel, select consonants, buy vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase.
    The wheel can be "spun" at different strengths by sliding a bar across a
    selector, and the chances of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and going
    bankrupt remain.
    .
    Game play is for up to two players taking turns, or for one player against the
    computer.  Gameplay moves through three rounds, and a bonus round for a grand
    prize.  Winning is accomplished, essentially, by earning the most money and
    winning the game by solving the phrases.
    .
    There is even a "sexy model" that animates out onto the "stage"--though the
    resemblance to Vanna White is minimal at best.

  description:
    Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and
    river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught
    with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life
    if contact is made.
    .
    The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself
    is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use
    the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and
    alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open
    home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have
    been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.

  description:
    While in the basement of Uncle Scrooge's mansion, Huey, Dewey and Louie discover
    an old piece of paper.  When they show it to Uncle Scrooge, he recognizes it as
    part of his great, great Uncle Fergus McDuck's legendary treasure map!  With the
    remaining parts of the map hidden around the world, it's up to Uncle Scrooge to
    find them and discover Fergus McDuck's secret treasure!
    .
    Duck Tales 2 is the sequel to the NES and Game Boy game, Duck Tales.  Based on
    the Disney cartoon of the same name, players control Uncle Scrooge as he
    searches the globe for massive amounts of wealth while trying to discover hidden
    pieces of the map.
    .
    Scrooge's main method of attack is his cane - by jumping in the air and holding
    the B Button, the cane turns into a pogo stick, allowing players to jump onto
    most enemies' heads and cross dangerous terrain like spikes with ease.  By
    pushing up against a wall or an object, Scrooge will whack his cane like a golf
    club, either sending the object flying or occasionally revealing secret items.
    New to Duck Tales 2 is the ability to push and pull certain objects with the
    cane after hitting them.
    .
    Familiar faces such as Huey, Dewey and Louie, Webby, Mrs. Beakley, and Launchpad
    McQuack all turn up to lend a hand.  Scrooge will even bump into the crazy
    inventor, Gyro Gearloose, who will improve Scrooge's cane so that he can access
    even more secret areas.

  file: Blodia (Japan).zip
  developer: Tonkin House
  publisher: Tonkin House
  description:
    Blodia is a puzzle game with similarities to sliding block puzzles. Each level
    is composed of a number of tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or
    angular) on it - except one which is just a black hole. In one tile a red ball
    starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank.
    .
    The goal of each level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without
    meeting the hole or a blank tile.\n
    To ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer.
    So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from
    the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one
    towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At
    the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but
    after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite
    side of the playfield.
    .
    The game features all levels of the TurboGrafx-16 version plus additional ones.

    conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament

    installation gone wrong, Eddie is released, intending to go straight and retire.
    Unfortunately, fate has other plans.
    .
    Years ago, Leonardo Da Vinci created a machine with the intention of converting
    common lead into bronze for use on his commissioned sculpture of a horse. Da
    Vinci got the shock of his life when he found out the machine didn't convert
    lead to bronze... it converted it to gold. Knowing the ramifications of what the
    machine could do, Da Vinci broke the crystal that powered it into three pieces
    and hid them in three of his works: a miniature sculpture of a horse called the
    Sforza, his sketchbook and notebook called the Codex, and a miniature model of
    his helicopter design, hoping that they would never again see the light of day.
    .
    Unfortunately, ultra-rich psychotic yuppies Darwin and Minerva Mayflower have
    found out about the machine and own one piece of the crystal. Planning to flood
    the market with gold and crush the global economy, they need the remaining
    crystal pieces and require Eddie's services. To force him to comply, they kidnap
    his best friend and partner Tommy "Five-Tone" Messina and threaten to have him
    killed unless Eddie fetches them. With no choice, Eddie will have to do the
    jobs, save his friend, and put an end to the Mayflowers' plot.
    .
    From Rutherford's Auction House in New York, to the Vatican, and finally Castle
    Da Vinci in Italy, Eddie will have to dodge an odd assortment of enemies, from
    security guards and guard dogs, to janitors, crazed nuns, balloon-riding
    henchmen, paparazzi, and kids on bikes. Hawk's sole tool of the trade, aside
    from a wicked punch, is a baseball, of which he has an infinite supply. He'll
    use this to subdue enemies, distract guard dogs, and trigger switches. Eddie can
    also crawl to avoid shots and the occasional security beam. There's also ropes
    and pipes to shimmy across to avoid traps, and boxes to push and stack to reach
    those out of reach areas.

    Tornados) and the same game modes: exhibition matches, tournaments (group stage
    plus knockout stage), playoffs (only the knockout stage) and a league mode.

    Changes are an entirely new menu frontend and revised controls. In particular,
    the Game Boy's two buttons no longer distinguish between the strength of kicks
    with the choice between a goal kick and a pass depending entirely on the
    situation; the buttons for passes and kicks are now distinct.

    puzzles are much more advanced than those in Mario's Picross - easy puzzles are

    together, solved one section at a time.

    Picross puzzles with Mario.  In this mode, the timer ticks down from 30 minutes,
    and you must solve the puzzle before the timer reaches zero.  If you chip away
    an incorrect square, you are penalized time (first two minutes, then four, then
    eight).

    After solving a certain amount of puzzles in Mario's Picross mode, you can play
    Wario's Picross.  In this mode, the timer starts from zero and counts upwards.
    You are not penalized time for any mistakes, however, this means that you do not
    know which squares are correct and which ones are incorrect until the puzzle is

    played by selecting icons for passing, shooting and blocking. The game features
    smooth animation. A simulation game of the Tsubasa-kun type. The development of
    the basketball game is simplified as much as possible. It is easy to understand.
    Even an amateur basketball player can enjoy this game. Also, it's pretty cool
    the way it faithfully reproduces the graphics of the original series.

    Un RPG basado en la obra original de Hiroshi Motomiya, que se hizo popular en la

    los señores de la guerra enemigos en 15 provincias chinas y unificar toda China.
    La versión de NES intentó hacerlo como una simulación, pero ésta se convirtió en
    un tipo de RPG limpio. El sistema ya no es único, pero está bien equilibrado, y
    la historia es fácil de disfrutar. También es bueno saber que no hay detalles

  description:
    A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink. The gameplay
    involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on
    spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in
    turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in
    an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but
    taking one two spaces away.
    .
    When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into
    that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with
    any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is
    full.

  developer: Ocean

  description:
    Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the
    role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A.
    Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a
    linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very
    well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs,
    crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion
    and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with
    normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil
    slicks and stray cows.
    .
    By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with
    which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit
    something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus
    your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it
    is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.
    .
    Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no
    intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode,
    this is not simultaneous.

    DK and Diddy Kong have left in search of The Lost World after hearing of a
    contest to find it on the radio.  This leaves Dixie stuck with minding her baby
    cousin Kiddy Kong.  Frustrated at this, she decides to take Kiddy with her and
    find The Lost World before everyone else!
    .
    As with Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, Dixie Kong takes
    the lead in the third chapter of the Donkey Kong Land series. Dixie can glide
    using her hair, and carries barrels over her head.  Her partner is the heavy
    Kiddy, who carries barrels in front of him, and can jump a bit further by
    somersaulting over platform edges first.
    .
    There are also special animal friends that can help the two primates out.  Ellie
    the Elephant can shoot water at enemies, while Enguarde the Swordfish can glide
    through water with ease. Squawks the Parrot can fly and spit eggs, and Squitter
    the Spider can shoot webbing as well as use it to create new platforms.
    .
    Each level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked well away in the levels.  While
    it's possible to gain an ending without these, to complete the game properly,
    players must seek them all out and unlock levels of the fabled 'Lost World'.  A
    new feature to the game series is a Time Attack mode - once players finish the
    game, they can attempt to beat the best time for certain levels.

    a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely
    walking.
    .
    Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when
    you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top
    of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to
    turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and
    he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like
    the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the
    water (you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover
    beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities
    function just like boss weapons.
    .
    When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least
    a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single
    power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but
    superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter.
    There are eight of these, corresponding to the eight main levels, even though
    there are twenty-one levels in the entire game.
    .
    Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also
    collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your
    health. You start the game with three lives. Other features include Surprise
    Boxes lying around for you to find. There are infinite continues and a password
    feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.

  developer: Interplay

  description:
    The crossover of the two 80s Action/Sci-Fi franchises comes to the Game Boy in
    this platform title, based very loosely on a Dark Horse comic.
    .
    The player controls RoboCop, who, while taking care of law & order in Detroit,
    discovers some unusual troublemakers: Terminators sent from the future. To deal
    with the threat, Robo will have to make his way through an OCP factory and
    computer complex, where a time machine awaits that will take him to the
    post-nuclear wasteland of future Los Angeles. There, he must destroy the Skynet
    mainframe to free humanity from the machines once and for all.
    .
    The game is a platforming affair. RoboCop must destroy various enemies while
    looking for the level exit, from various criminals in Detroit to advanced
    robotic probes, Terminators and flying Hunter Killers in in the OCP labs and the
    future. He is armed with a simple gun which can be upgraded once to a
    three-directional scatter shot. A single hit means the gun upgrade is lost,
    though. Life energy can be refilled through power-ups, and extra lives are also
    available.

    kari no Yōsai 2 is set after the happenings of Fortified Zone. The two special
    agents Masato Kanzaki and Mizuki Makimura receive a new important mission:
    destroying the ultimate weapon the enemy is developing in its secret base.
    .
    This is a top-down action game in which the player needs to find a way through a
    maze-like environment while shooting enemies. Sometimes there is also a key to
    find in order to open a closed door. Of course enemy contact should be avoided
    because it drains the life energy. The most important feature of the game are
    the two mercenaries which have different abilities (Masato is slow and has high
    stamina, Mizuki the opposite) and can be switched instantly.
    .
    While the basic gameplay concept is unchanged from the predecessor, there are
    two major differences: the characters can be moved diagonally and, besides
    health pick-ups, there are no power-ups anymore. The special weapons for each
    character can be switched in an extra menu, the weapons have unlimited ammo and
    the effects of the other power-ups (increasing attack range, attack power, etc.)
    have been incorporated into the protagonist's differences.

    Family Jockey is a horse racing game for the Nintendo Famicom. You can choose
    between a one player or two player simultaneous mode. At the start you must
    choose a horse. Horses have different skill levels like speed, stamina or jump.
    During the race the horses and the course are displayed from a top-down view.
    You increase the speed of your horse by using your whip, which in return results
    in an energy decrease, so it must be used with care. There are two different
    surface types (lawn and dirt) and some courses have obstacles that you have to
    jump over. You must place at least in the top 4 of each race to continue with
    the game. Placing higher increases the prize money. Besides a mode that
    concentrates purely on the racing part you can choose a so called "Family Game"
    which includes a betting part in addition to the racing.

    A powerful human called Krond conquers the Monster Planet, bans all music and
    declares himself king. Max, a monster rock musician decides to fight back. In
    order to defeat the evil monarch, he enlists in the training course at the Mega
    Hero Academy.
    .
    Monster Max is a surreal isometric adventure by the same duo that created the
    8-bit classic Head Over Heels. Not surprisingly it is very similar to that game
    in terms of control and general design, and almost identical graphically. The
    character moves on a bizarre landscape, where he has to collect and use objects
    (with either the A or B button) to accomplish mission objectives. The game
    starts on a training academy that serves as the mission hub. Each mission has as
    an entrance with a terminal and a door. By touching the terminal with the
    character, the mission objective and reward is displayed on the screen. The
    missions available can be played in any order, but Max has to pay a fee to
    access other levels with more advanced missions. On the top left of the screen
    there is a counter for the lucky stars collected. Lucky stars allow the
    character to touch dangerous objects once without suffering damage. Besides that
    are several hearts representing the number of lives. On the top right is the
    inventory display, showing the two objects assigned to the buttons. Hitting
    START while on a mission brings up a map, while pressing SELECT displays a menu
    with options and the password at the bottom of the screen.
    .
    .
    The game is far larger than previous isometric adventures like Knight Lore, with
    over 600 more detailed locations (the double of Head Over Heels). There is a
    password system to save progress.

    the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

    The game is very similar to Nintendo's own NES version of the game, featuring
    the same "Type A" endless and "Type B" set-clear modes. The game also features a
    2-player versus mode that can be played with two Game Boys, two copies of

    Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES Play Action Football. While
    Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of
    the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the
    appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989
    season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB,
    RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.
    .
    Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a
    three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the
    bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12
    running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively
    gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays
    and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a
    fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.
    .
    Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There
    are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field
    goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in
    audio) whenever a team moves the chains. Team stats are displayed on a summary
    screen after every quarter of play. Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs
    mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all
    in the Power Bowl!

    into full action at all times. As soon as a line of blocks reaches the bottom
    line, it is Game Over. Then you'll be granted 10 seconds to decide if you want

    simultaneously with a friend as Genghis) through various devious levels.  The
    goal of each level is to eat enough Nibbleys (round creatures which come in
    assorted flavors including balloons, jellyfish, joggers, and more) to earn
    enough tail segments.  When your snake has enough segments, its body will flash,
    and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate and progress to the next level.
    .
    Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if this runs out, a giant ax will
    appear, chasing after your snake until it eventually destroys it.  To prevent
    this from occurring, you can collect clocks which add another 30 seconds to your
    time limit.  You can also collect power ups such as increased jump height,
    tongue extensions, and diamonds which briefly make you invincible.

    parts has its own) and during melee combat, the direction of the punches is
    controlled.

    Each successful hit gives points which decide the winner if no fighter goes down
    within the time limit. A knockdown is achieved by emptying the opponent's life
    bar. Additionally each hit (with a big bonus for winning) gives prize money
    which in turn is invested in upgrading the robot. The player can buy new parts
    for the four components (main body, legs and the individual arms) - but an
    upgraded robot also influences the difficulty of the next enemy. While being

    colour (or any combination of pills and viruses totaling four or more) and it
    will be removed from the bottle, along with the aligned pills. The level is
    cleared when there are no viruses left, and the game is over when the pills
    reach the top and Dr. Mario can't drop any more pills.

  game: Nobunaga's Ambition
  file: Nobunaga's Ambition (USA).zip
  developer: Koei
  publisher: Koei
  description:
    In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the
    nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would
    often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming
    the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious
    Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the
    role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.
    .
    Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in
    different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three
    Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a
    larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is
    rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and
    IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game.
    The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes
    increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.
    .
    During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands
    from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying
    Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe
    & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the
    defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each
    player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move,
    bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them
    into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of
    enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

    Jelly Boy is a gelatinous humanoid pink blob on a mission throughout some
    strange worlds. He travels throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories and
    arctic snowfields during his quest, facing down all manner of dangerous enemies
    and obstacles. He can jump and he can  launch a large fist from his stomach (he
    is a blob, after all). Further, different levels have special power-ups that
    allow the blob to assume different forms that are useful in specific
    circumstances. These include a hot air balloon (for floating up to special
    items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing blocks), a submarine (for more
    effectively navigating an undersea bonus level), a skateboard (for blazing
    through a level on a deadline), and a pogo stick (for extra high jumping). Not
    all of the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns Jelly Boy into a block
    so that he is unable to move for several seconds.
    .
    Jelly Boy collects musical notes in lieu of having a power meter. Being hit
    knocks away all of his collected notes and if he gets hit again without having
    any notes, he will lose a life. Jelly Boy also collects a variety of fruit
    throughout his quest. Accumulate enough fruit to earn extra lives. Certain types
    of fruit have other side effects (orange = more time on the clock, avocado =
    invincibility).

    In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the

    crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created
    based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon,
    because the Invaders are back!
    .
    Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see
    Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from
    Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many
    power-ups and enemies.
    .
    You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the
    screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start
    at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and
    finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow),
    plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by
    shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game,
    there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if
    you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double
    shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a
    unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a
    reproduction of the original coin-op.

    Garuda, an evil dictator, threatens New York city and it is up to the Ryu
    Hayabusa to fight him.

    higher platforms, which can then be hand-climbed across. By collecting power ups

    which can be replenished by finding proper power ups inside containers.

    ranging from the five-hit aircraft carriers to the two hit cruisers, even a
    fighter jet in later levels.

    The second mode is more of a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a
    submarine, trying to destroy the enemy fleet before they take the player's
    vessel out. Either the player takes out all the battleships causing the enemy
    submarine to surrender or he directly destroys the submarine to end the level.
    When submerged a radar view appears, showing the player's ships along with the
    enemies, providing a strategic intermission to plot out the attack.

    In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited
    to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to
    feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing
    one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3D movement, Toshinden's game play
    can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less
    depth to the moves.
    .
    Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a
    lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port
    of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing
    the same characters, attacks and controls.
    .
    The U.S and E.U PlayStation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in
    English and redone music using different instruments.
    .
    The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually
    in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature.
    .
    Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted,
    for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices
    generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far
    less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.
    .
    The later DOS version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese
    PlayStation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower

  description:
    Mr. Chin is hungry!  Help him eat his favorite snack, the delectable peach, by
    using laser emitting bowls to trap enemies and making them safe to chomp up.
    As Mr. Chin, you can drop bowls on the ground with the B Button.  If you place
    one bowl on the left and one on the right, a laser will fire between the two
    bowls, and any enemies will be caught between, transforming into peaches.  Mr.
    Chin can then gobble up the peaches - if he grabs more in a row, their value
    increases (Mr. Chin's score is measured in calories).  When Mr. Chin eats all
    the enemies on-screen, more quickly take their place.  Gobble them all up, and
    when there are no more enemies in the level, you can progress to the next one.
    .
    Enemies in the levels can walk on thin line paths, but Mr. Chin will fall
    through these - he can only walk on bricks.  Mr. Chin can also smash the bricks
    by punching them from underneath - sometimes this will reveal a power up, such
    as invincibility and the ability to turn all foes into peaches instantly.

    fall down from the top into a cylinder. They can be moved left or right, rotated
    in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to get four puyos of
    the same color touching each other horizontally or vertically. Doing so removes
    them from the field. Making groups of larger than four, several at the same time
    or creating chain reactions nets more points. The game ends once the stacked
    puyos reach the top of the cylinder.

    The game offers an endless single-player mode, a two-player mode (first player
    to fill their cylinder loses) and a mission mode. Mission mode presents the
    player with a number of pre-filled playing fields with a preset task, like

    take matters into her own hands. That young girl was Sonia Belmont, the first in

    While Castlevania Legends plays similar to the earlier Castlevania titles (the

    stages plus a hidden stage), there are also some unique features. While it is
    impossible to roam the stages freely, quite often the player can choose to go
    one way or another and in doing so skip some areas or find valuable items,
    collecting all of which will unlock the best ending. Sonia also possesses
    special power called Burning mode: once in a level (and once per life) she can
    boost her speed and attack power and become invincible for a short period of
    time.
    .
    Each of the game's bosses leaves behind an orb with a Soul weapon inside. Sonia
    can collect five of these weapons: Wind, Ice, Flame, Saint and Magic. Similar to
    previous games these are activated by pressing up+attack, and require a certain
    number of hearts. The player can switch to any Soul Power at any moment at a
    weapon select screen. Sonia's whip can be upgraded three times, the third
    upgrade adding a fireball-like projectile.

    finally save Princess Daphne. The game world is divided in several screens which
    can be freely navigated and are a little wider than Game Boy's screen. As Dirk
    moves the screen will scroll and when its limit is reached, it will flick to a
    new one. To help him move around, Dirk can jump over bumper cars, flying magic
    hats and other kinds of moving platforms.
    .
    Dirk starts with 10 lives which can be lost by falling from high platforms,
    touching spikes or landing on water or fire. The main theme is somewhat
    reminiscent from the NES version. The game can be played in two different speeds
    and can also be played by two players taking turns.

    criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car

    limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time
    getting on the road again.

    idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major
    Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.
    .
    As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in
    simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants
    bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right,
    and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll always have your
    machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way
    include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame

    Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of
    pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many
    of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are
    seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners
    rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the
    flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered
    from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece
    can't flow into, the pipe is finished.
    .
    Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position,
    the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down
    anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and
    complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled.
    Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it
    easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.
    .
    Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5
    cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen.
    Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the
    side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After
    every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only
    place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board
    game of "Connect 4".

    your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters,
    called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon
    that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the
    point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the
    monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are
    scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If
    the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get
    turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are
    invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in
    the center, and you can get these for points.

    inputting a three letter code which offers several thousand possible
    combinations of the tiles within that pattern.

    Rather than removing tiles in pairs on the edge of the pattern in order to
    access buried tiles, as is the norm in Shanghai, the player can select any tile
    on the board as long as it corresponds to the tile the game requests. However,
    points are scored based on how many other tiles surround the selected tile: A
    maximum of 320 points are awarded for tiles completely surrounded on all six
    sides by other tiles. Any tiles that aren't "standing" on at least one other
    tile will fall off the board causing a premature game over: players need to
    balance earning points by removing entrenched tiles while ensuring that no tile
    will fall off the table as a result of the removal.

    style, so if you don't speak Japanese you'll struggle a bit with that aspect.
    However, you can beat the game even if you do poorly in the battles. The overall
    difficulty is very low, mostly because some of your recipes (which are used as
    spells in this game) will basically give you infinite HP, and some battle
    choices will tell you the correct answers to quiz questions. Mai is cooking in
    the kitchen with her friends Yajama and Ojama when she receives a letter from a
    demon telling her that he has kidnapped her brother. Mai must explore eight

    and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and
    keeping an eye on Jeep.
    .
    .
    Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure
    takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and
    open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must
    be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered
    hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often
    hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level.
    There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a
    punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles
    Popeye can move on to the next level.
    .
    .
    The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side
    of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous
    levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as
    Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and
    snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the
    game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he
    makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.
    .
    .
    Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it
    punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for
    finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain
    call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as
    Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.

    will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over
    to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out,
    and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins.
    Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.

  description:
    The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman's KO Boxing are
    fairly identical to the other versions in concept, but there are a few notable
    changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster'
    Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same
    name, which is entirely different.
    .
    Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a
    series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship
    title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and
    show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to
    avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that
    can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when
    no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's
    points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to
    be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow
    or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.
    .
    Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be
    charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the
    back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the
    ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won
    match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three
    characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.

  description:
    BurgerTime Deluxe is a new version of the classic arcade game from 1982,
    developed for the casual market. As in the original, the player controls a
    cooking chef that must climb stairs to reach platforms and walk over food
    pieces, to make them fall and create a complete hamburgers on plates at the
    bottom of the screen. The cook must avoid touching the roaming enemies,
    anthropomorphic condiments and fried eggs that kill the main character. The foes
    can be destroyed with power-ups, or squashed by the falling burger pieces.
    .
    There are power-ups and bonus items scattered throughout the levels. The ketchup
    bottle kills all the enemies on the level, the salt shaker stops their movement
    for a few seconds, the ice cube makes the chef invulnerable for a few moments
    and freezes the adversaries, the burning cocktail also makes the cook
    invulnerable for a short time and burns the approaching foes, the bubble lifts
    the character directly to an upper level and the energy drink makes the chef
    temporally faster. Potato chips, ice-cream cones, cups of coffee and tea give
    bonus points, while French fries give extra lives. A Bonus mini-game appears
    between levels after collecting the letters that form the name of an ingredient,
    where the player has to find pairs of food items by uncovering several cooking
    pots, guide the chef through a maze and complete other similar challenges.
    .
    There are two modes in the computer version: in Story Mode, a plot is developed
    through cutscenes between levels, where two chefs called Peter Pepper and Sally
    Salt must help their uncle to save the family's burger diner from Vinny Vinegar,
    the owner of a competing hot dog franchise. Quick Mode is closer to the arcade
    original, where the levels are randomly generated and the game ends when all the
    lives are spent. The iPhone version has only the Story Mode, with 60 levels and
    a smaller view area.

  description:
    R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and
    strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch
    effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.
    .
    The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the
    smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire
    button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy,
    eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods
    will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade.
    The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons
    pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any
    enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them.
    You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in.
    Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both
    as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in
    order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking
    missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their
    colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across
    the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow
    one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).
    .
    The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R.
    Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered
    trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other
    shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is
    exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the
    screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the
    levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the
    memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

    Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The
    enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player
    controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect
    items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the
    ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to
    trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them,
    wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in
    bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and
    water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms.

    blocks (either pushing them normally or send them flying with a strong kick) and
    holes.
    .
    There are also monsters which need to be avoided. All five of them have
    different behaviour patterns and have the ability to reverse already flipped
    tiles; some of them can even push blocks or destroy tiles. The monsters can be
    killed by using blocks against them: pushing them over the borders of the
    playfield or a hole will kill them. Alternatively they also can be trapped.
    Killed monsters slowly respawn at pre-defined spawn points; this takes place
    over several phases. In the "egg" phase, it can be picked up to kill another
    enemy with it. Another possible weapon are stunned enemies which stood on a
    multi-flipped row.
    .
    When pushing blocks into a corner, they will disappear and transform into power
    ups, e.g. bonus points, extra time or a temporary stun of all enemies. A life is
    lost when an enemy is touched or the time runs out. When that happens, all
    flipped tiles stay flipped.

    Banished to a mysterious underground labyrinth of complex mazes, two explorers
    are faced with one chance to reverse the curse: solve all 100 puzzles set out in
    mazes before them.
    .
    But watch it! Every maze has monsters patrolling the depths of the labyrinth.
    Help Catgirl and Catboy push around huge blocks to bridge a path to yet another
    maze, or topple a block a few stories over the pursuing monsters. If you make a
    mistake, simply use the rewind function and travel back in time to correct it.
    With 100 mazes in this labyrinth, it will be quite a challenge to get out of the
    curse's reach!
    .
    Catrap is more than just a game of mindbending intrigue and action. Be the
    architect of the underground labyrinth and make your own games of intricate
    puzzles.
    .
    Whether you choose to be a maze builder or a maze solver, we know you can help
    Catboy and Catgirl land on their feet.
    .
    Catrap (known as Pitman in Japan) is a puzzle game in which the player maneuvers
    the player, an anthropomorphic cat, to navigate a room while clearing obstacles
    and kicking monsters and ghosts off the screen. Once the player has knocked all
    of the enemies off the screen, he advances to the next level. Advancement can
    prove difficult for the player as increasingly intricate obstacles are presented
    to overcome all of the monsters and ghosts. Arguably, the easiest route to solve
    the problem is through trial and error. A player may try one combination of
    maneuvers by moving the obstacle in one direction, then he may find himself
    trapped. The player can hit the 'A'-button to reverse his movements and try
    again in a different way until he finds the solution that enables him to access
    all of the baddies to knock them off the screen. Trial and error seems to make
    up a large portion of the game. Players can also create their own mazes. The
    game is credited with having originated the time-rewind mechanic.

  game: The Lawnmower Man

  developer: Time Warner Interactive
  publisher: Time Warner Interactive
  description:
    The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself
    loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce
    Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries
    in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of
    primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.
    .
    With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the
    chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation,
    and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he
    notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs
    such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly
    increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the
    experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the
    drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the
    treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take
    revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to
    take over all computers in the world.
    .
    While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both
    cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or
    Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting
    action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after
    collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives
    protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the
    movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.
    .
    The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences
    of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional
    shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual
    World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different
    approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging
    obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to
    Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person
    and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel
    with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

  description:
    A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented
    over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other
    warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a
    loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty
    space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.
    .
    Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are
    left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to
    ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe
    Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.
    .
    Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players.
    Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and
    style.
    .
    Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score
    and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.
    .
    The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random
    pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It
    is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one
    remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often
    effective.

    The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions
    away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at
    normal speed, and police. Before each race you will be told of the quality of
    the locals and the likelihood of police presence.
    .
    When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 km/h could see you branded as
    an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase
    H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage
    (which eventually hampers your speed) or simply pull over and accept a fine and
    the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is
    heavier.
    .
    Each race costs money to enter and your earnings can be boosted by betting on
    the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver
    gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower.
    If a local wins you get your stake back.

    Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers,
    engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the
    Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time
    limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.

    Pocahontas is a side-scrolling platformer based on the Native American Indian
    later made famous in a Disney movie by the same name.

    The player alternates between Pocahontas and John Smith to complete seven
    missions. In levels one, two and four, Pocahontas needs to collect feathers for
    a Shaman woman to receive magic cards, travel through the forest while avoiding
    the spirit beat, and shake off a boy who chases her to prevent her from reaching
    the white man's camp respectively.
    .
    John Smith is playable in the levels three, five and six. In the third level the
    American explorer needs to shoot animals running and passing by, on separate
    planes, by aiming his gun with the mouse. He needs to shoot enough animals to
    feed his men before it gets dark. The objective is the same in the fifth level,
    but there he is in a canoe and needs to catch fish.
    .

    In the sixth level he leaps over ravines and across rivers until he meets
    Pocahontas. Together, they help each other cross a lake. In the final level both
    characters are controlled as they need to work together to catch a bear.

    Next to regular platforming mechanics such as running, climbing, jumping and
    swinging, there are some minor puzzle elements involving items that are selected
    from the bottom of the screen. That part also holds a progress bar to show how
    close the objectives are. Characters are generally controlled with four movement
    keys. The mouse cursor is visible on the screen and acts as a guide to show the
    possible actions. Clicking left or right offers different actions.

    WCW: The Main Event is a professional wrestling video game released in 1994 by
    FCI for the Nintendo Game Boy portable video game system. It was just the second
    video game based on World Championship Wrestling, and the first of two released
    to a handheld console.
    .
    Gameplay
    .
    There are two types of matches available: a set number of falls (best of one,
    three, or five) and a set time limit (five, ten, or fifteen minutes). Each
    wrestler has his unique special move along with punch, clothesline, bodyslam,
    suplex, dropkick, and cross body block. One can choose between a single match
    and an elimination match which runs the gauntlet of the remaining wrestlers.\n
    Throwing one's opponent out of the ring is possible, as is fighting outside of
    the ring. There is no ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of the ring,
    but one will start after one enters.\n
    [edit]Wrestlers
    .
    These wrestlers used in the game were considered to be the top-ranked superstars
    of the WCW as of 1993. They were Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting,
    Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and former tag team duo The Steiner
    Brothers (who had left for the WWF but still appeared in the game anyway).

    Se trata de la versión para Game Boy del juego de fútbol en el que los jugadores
    conocidos de la J-League aparecen con sus nombres reales. Incluso puedes añadir
    tus propios jugadores a tu equipo y hacer que jueguen en los partidos. El campo
    es tan pequeño que es difícil ver dónde están tus compañeros de equipo, y ni
    siquiera puedes ver dónde está la portería durante una tanda de penaltis.
    Tampoco hay una ruta de búsqueda, por lo que tienes que regatear por tu cuenta.
    Sin embargo, el deslizamiento es tan ineficaz que todavía se puede llevar hasta
    la meta.

  description:
    The player begins the game by taking control of Michaelangelo, who must rescue
    the other turtles, along with Splinter and April O'Neil, who have been kidnapped
    by Shredder.[2] Unlike other games based on the franchise, this is a scrolling
    action-adventure game reminiscent of the Metroid and the later Castlevania:
    Symphony of the Night. Each turtle has a different ability which is necessary to
    finish the game. Michaelangelo can hover using his nunchakus as a helicopter,
    Leonardo can drill the floor by spinning with his katana, Raphael can hide
    himself inside his shell to enter passages that are otherwise too small to
    enter, and Donatello can stick to and climb walls.
    .
    The bosses are Scratch, Dirtbag, a Triceraton, Scale Tale, and Shredder (in this
    game known as Cyber-Shredder).
