    features from other baseball games are present and has three different game
    modes to choose from: exhibition, playoff, and home run derby, but what makes

    Nixon, Bobby Larkin among many others.

  description:
    Virtua Hamster is a unreleased Sega 32X game. The game was to star a variety of
    selectable rodents attached to rocket packs who could travel through a series of
    connected tubes, fighting each other and avoiding various obstacles.
    .
    It was built solely with the 32X in mind, however after the console failed
    development moved to the Sega Saturn for a short while before being axed
    completely. It is also reported that Sega of Japan were not keen on use of the
    "Virtua" in the game's name, possibly so that the game was not associated with
    Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter and Virtua Racing. An alternate box mock-up uses the
    title Virtual Hamster instead.
    .
    In August 2009, Ryo Suzuki of SEGASaturno.com dumped an early prototype version
    of this game. In it, the only selectable character is hamster, Chip, and there
    is only one empty level (though there are numerous non-moving 3D models of other
    characters and items dotted around the map). A resets the game, and B/C can be
    used to move the camera forwards and backwards through the tube. There are also
    two Sega screens.

    .
    Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a
    one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves.
    Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game.
    Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the
    other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include
    single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.

  description:
    One of the last 32X games released (and exclusively in Europe), DarXide is a 3-D
    space shooter, inspired in part by the arcade gameplay of Asteroids. It is one
    of the few 32X games to used texture-mapped polygons.
    .
    Players control a lone starship rushing to destroy oncoming asteroids and alien
    vessels before they annihilate defenseless human miners and colonies. Asteroids
    break apart into smaller rocks, which much also be hunted down and destroyed.
    Aliens likewise arrive in larger, more dangerous vessels.
    .
    Asteroids broken down to their smallest size and then vaporized will sometimes
    drop shield or energy recharges, to repair damage caused by laser blasts or
    collisions. New weapons can also be found. Players have a time limit to meet all
    objectives in a stage before they are forced to land and try again. The right
    side of the HUD shows asteroids remaining (and their approximate size), while
    the left shows the player's distance to their base (and so, time remaining in
    the stage).

  game: Metal Head
  file: Metal Head (Japan, USA) (En,Ja).zip
  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    It's 5 years after the formation of the Worldwide Federation.  Although war has
    been averted, terrorist cells around the world threaten the stability of the
    federation.  To combat this menace, the Federation has created a bi-pedal
    armored tank known as the Metal Head.  You are a Metal Head pilot, and you have
    to use all the weapons at your disposal to take out the terrorists.
    .
    Metal Head is a bit of a variation on the usual giant robot combat game.  The
    game's mission areas bear more resemblance to a first-person shooter than a
    simulation.  The graphics are all rendered in texture mapped polygons, which is
    unusual for a 32X game.

    Knuckles' Chaotix is a spin-off of the Sonic the Hedgehog series of Genesis
    games. Knuckles the Echidna (from Sonic the Hedgehog 3) works at Carnival
    Island, an amusement park where his job is to protect the park and make it a

    He wants the power emerald which supplies electricity to the entire island.

    confiner." This contraption only allows Knuckles to free one of his friends at a
    time by using a ring force bond.

  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    This 32X-exclusive sci-fi shooter has gameplay is somewhat like Sega arcade
    classic Zaxxon. The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which
    creates a pseudo 3D environment.  The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling
    planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons.
    .
    Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without
    getting shot, the game has a strategic element.  Your basic spacecraft has very
    little firepower, and can only sustain one hit.  To make matters worse, there
    are very few power-ups.  In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies
    and take control of their weapons systems.  This system allows for a large
    variety of player-controllable ships.

  game: After Burner

  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is
    simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft
    has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns).
    In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all
    the time.
    .
    The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of
    enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you
    spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a
    friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.
