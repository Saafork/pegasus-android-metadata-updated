  description:
    Tyrannosaurus Tex é um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa inédito para o console
    portátil Nintendo Game Boy Color. O jogo gerou grandes expectativas.\n
    Um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa no Game Boy Color parece ser um desafio para
    os padrões de qualquer um, então não é de surpreender que o Tyrannosaurus Tex
    tenha sido criado por alguém com vontade de fazer o que ninguém havia feito
    antes. Tendo deixado Psygnosis depois de trabalhar em títulos como a série
    Colony Wars, Ben John fundou a Slitherine Software, baseada no Reino Unido, e
    começou a flexionar seus músculos de codificação. Depois de considerar um jogo
    RTS no estilo Command & Conquer, ele estabeleceu um FPS e começou a trabalhar em
    uma demonstração de tecnologia no início de 1999. Contando com a ajuda de seu
    amigo Dan Crawley (conceito / personagem) e pai Mike John (designer), o A
    demonstração foi exibida na Feira Européia de Computação de 1999 e atraiu a
    atenção de editores como Codemasters, Take2 e THQ. O jogo acabou sendo assinado
    pela Eidos, que adicionou o produtor Iain McNeil ao time. A produção completa
    começou em setembro de 1999 com uma data planejada de lançamento em abril de
    2000.

  developer: Konami

  description:
    Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!! marks another platformer entry in the Ganbare
    Goemon series. Forgoing RPG touches, the game returns to the action / platformer
    roots of the 16-bit titles by casting you as Goemon and his pal Ebisumaru as
    they traverse several levels based on a bizarre version of feudal Japan in hopes
    of defeating the forces of an evil alien invader.
    .
    The Game alternates between stages featuring either Goemon or Ebisumaru. Each
    character takes a different route towards the bad guy and as a result the stages
    scroll differently for each character. You can collect upgraded items and
    weapons but there's no character upgrading besides that. The game also features
    mid-level bonus rounds featuring the rest of Goemon's buddies in several arcade
    mini-games as traditional for the series.

    Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage.  Rampage World
    Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George,
    Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste.  George has
    turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some
    sort of gigantic wolf.  The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and
    then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe.
    .
    The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying
    buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on
    tanks.  The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by
    traveling to the cities where they are located.  Being creatures of such massive
    size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way.  Scumlabs and
    the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another
    player that can play simultaneously.
    .
    The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful "cartoon"
    flavor.  Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and
    eating their inhabitants to destroy them.  Once all the buildings for a
    particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to
    the next stage.  Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make
    them more powerful or restore health.

  description:
    A Bug's Life is a platform game with different goals in each of 15 levels. Most
    of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match
    the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can
    proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from
    the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player
    gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that
    spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each
    enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating
    telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go.
    Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially
    buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific
    kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can
    increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered
    throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can
    be grown with it. Some levels also included Flikâ€™s harvesting invention
    (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off
    enemy bugs.

    a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and
    others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers,
    snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty,
    Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special
    blend of villainy.
    .
    Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly.
    For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with
    a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther.
    On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run
    really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a
    shield against frontal attacks.
    .
    The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels.
    Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and
    lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of
    a minor enemy.

    his life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those animals have
    different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the

    Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete
    plans to race!  You'll have to speed across the country to catch up with the
    weasels and rescue Pluto!
    .
    Mickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as
    Mickey's Racing Adventure.  Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald,
    Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around
    various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los
    Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name
    a few.
    .
    The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style.  You must complete
    four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you're given points based
    on your placing.  The player with the most points at the end of the four races
    wins the trophy for that circuit.  There are assorted power-ups that help you as
    you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a
    homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil
    slick).
    .
    There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you've
    previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to
    race fast enough to beat the track's lap time and earn a gold star in every
    race.  Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'.  In this mode,
    you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking
    and slalom driving.  The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you
    will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal).  However, you will
    receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so
    accuracy counts as well.
    .
    Mickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can
    play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure
    via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of
    Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.  As you progress through the game,
    you'll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed
    out via the Game Boy Printer.

    Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this
    cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also
    says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are
    guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero
    strong enough to defeat such monsters.
    .
    This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas
    by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few
    seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range
    of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a
    fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.
    .
    Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a
    dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After
    all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In
    most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your
    jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.

  description:
    It's the 14th annual Jellystone Park Balloon Fest. And you know what that means
    for Yogi...campers with pic-a-nic baskets! Yogi has a plan to get those baskets.
    He'll pose as a balloon salesman. He just needs to avoid Ranger Smith.
    .
    Boo Boo: "But, Yogi, the Ranger isn't going to like this."\n
    Yogi: "Not to worry, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!"
    .
    This is a puzzle game requiring strategy. A cloud above will hold several
    colored balloons while moving left or right. When it reaches the screen edge, it
    drops down a bit. You have a picnic basket with two balloons attached. By
    pressing the B button, you can rotate the balloons 90º and swap the colors. By
    pressing the A button, you release the balloons. The object is to get three
    balloons of the same color to touch. They will then pop and will be gone.
    Remember, the cloud is moving so time your release so the balloons go where you
    want. You are trying to clear all the balloons to move on.
    .
    Every fourth level is a boss level where you have Ranger Smith on top of the
    cloud. He stomps the cloud to lower it and drops a stone. If the stone hits your
    basket, you will release your balloons, whether you want to or not, and will not
    be able to move for a couple seconds. Once you clear all these balloons, you
    will have defeated Ranger Smith and will move on to the next area. If you match
    a balloon with an arrow in it, the cloud will move up a little. If the balloons
    reach the bottom, you lose. You can then choose to restart the level you were on
    or end the game.

    shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game,
    there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if
    you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double

  description:
    Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the
    role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A.
    Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a
    linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very
    well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs,
    crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion
    and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with
    normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil
    slicks and stray cows.
    .
    By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with
    which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit
    something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus
    your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it
    is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.
    .
    Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no
    intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode,
    this is not simultaneous.

    Metal Gear Solid (original Japanese name: Metal Gear: Ghost Babel) for GameBoy
    Color is not the same game as the popular Playstation/PC installment of the
    series. It is not set within the storyline of Metal Gear series, but instead
    tells an unrelated episode featuring the same hero - special agent Solid Snake.
    A secret government project, codenamed "Babel", attempts to revive the Metal
    Gear project - development of a highly destructive mech weapon. But an
    organization known as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal Gear
    prototype, without which any further development would be useless. Solid Snake
    is sent to infiltrate Outer Heaven, a location not entirely unfamiliar to him,
    and to retrieve the prototype.
    .
    The game is similar in style and gameplay to early Metal Gear games. It is
    viewed from top-down perspective, and its gameplay is mostly based on stealth.
    Snake has to sneak past the guards, using various tactics to distract them or to
    kill them silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all similar to those used in
    the other Metal Gear Solid game. From time to time Snake will also encounter
    bosses whom he will have to defeat in order to proceed to the next area. Virtual
    Missions for Snake are also included in this release.

    It can be considered an expansion: the same game engine but with new courses,

    appeared again in the series. It lacks a story mode, but all RPG elements
    (experience, leveling up, skill points...) for character building are still
    there.

    But what it made it so special was its Mobile Adapter compatibility, a special
    link cable that allowed internet connection through a cellphone. This allowed
    for massive multiplayer tournaments to be held, where participants could get
    amazing prizes like special clubs for use in-game and even extra courses and
    characters that could be considered DLC somehow.
    .
    There is now a fan translation patch which also changes the way DLC is unlocked
    in-game, so you can unlock them (courses, characters, minigames and clubs) by

    This little mouse has one big journey ahead of him, and you're just the one to
    help him out. Unfortunately, the Little family didn't foresee the possible
    conflict of interest in keeping a cat and mouse on the same household when they
    adopted Stuart, and that's proving to be a bit of a problem. Between newfound
    enemies and domestic obstacles, the tiny mouse is having one heck of a time!
    There are eight gigantic levels to conquer in The Journey Home, and each one is
    based on a scene from the box office smash STUART LITTLE movies (which are, of
    course, based on the book by E.B. White). You'll end up tackling a mini-golf
    course, Central Park, a model boat race, a bunch of toy cowboys, and more in
    this epic quest for peace. In addition, here are plenty of platforms and hazards
    to run, jump, and flip through, and three difficulty settings ensure that
    younger gamers and experienced veterans alike will find the game appealing.
    .
    In Stuart Little: The Journey Home, kids play as Stuart Little, the clever,
    ever-cheerful mouse from the popular Stuart Little movie and classic children's
    book of the same name. In the game, Stuart's just joined the Little family, and
    there's plenty of action to master, such as sliding down the laundry chute as a
    shortcut or using the flip-top bin to get more altitude. The Littles also join
    you in your play, as does Snowbell, the family cat who just can't warm up to
    even the most lovable of mice.
    .
    This side-scrolling game abounds with action that uses many of the movie's
    favorite locations. The Journey Home's eight levels of gameplay take Stuart
    through the thrilling model boat race, a topsy-turvy miniature golf course, a
    toy cowboy town, and New York's Central Park.
    .
    Every level is filled with power-ups and items that let you boost your energy
    and gain points. Three play settings make this a game that kids with varying
    skill levels can enjoy.

    background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In
    addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode;
    indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets;
    crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby
    space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty
    of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers,
    Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

    There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and

    or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the
    standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and
    hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat,
    Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.

    avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with
    the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at
    the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an
    hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation
    of your character.
    .
    The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and
    new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics
    but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.

    finding save points.

    various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or
    Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers,
    collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels
    like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans
    again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the
    game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels
    additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the
    difficulty of the game can be adjusted.
    .
    There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books
    of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at
    the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you
    have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the
    plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland
    you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in
    Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the
    desired trophy!

    When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, a young boy is swept castaway
    to a remote island by a fierce storm that destroys the entire ship.  With no

    uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home.
    .
    Survival Kids is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link's
    Awakening.  Players must try to survive through each day by getting enough rest,
    eating food and drinking water regularly.  This can be risky, as certain foods
    such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while
    other foods can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it.
    .
    The game also features a unique "merge" system, which allows you to create a
    number of different items by combining two other items.  For example, combining
    bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could
    create a bow.  There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to
    the essentials, so it's up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in
    their quest to survive.

    maneuvers to prove your air superiority. You can play in either Arcade or

  description:
    This to-go version of Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 is a top-down racing game,
    featuring two game modes (championship and arcade), 6 bikers and a variety of
    tracks in different scenarios.
    .
    Season mode features 3 championships, each with three stages composed of four
    races. The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the
    competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as
    well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.\n
    The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus
    faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into
    the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular
    flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp
    turns in a limited space.
    .
    While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks
    the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent,
    the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to
    barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the
    skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive
    in a close race.

    all the parts to put them together and to restore the witches' mental health.

    The game is an action-adventure. The seven levels, each corresponding to one
    witch and one part of the crystal ball, are full of monsters which hurt Bibi
    when she touches them. The health can be restored by finding sweets hidden in
    the level. Apart of monsters, there are persons which help her. In each level
    there is a magical item, often reachable only after getting through a little
    "game in game", that expands Bibi's magical powers, for example the broom that
    allows her to fly. The magic has to be used sparsely, because it costs magical
    energy, which can be recharged by finding little pulsating dots. This magical
    item is needed to get to the witch of the level, which Bibi has to fight. If she
    wins, the witch gets back to normal, gives her a part of the crystal ball and
    Bibi can go the the next level.

    There also is a password system that allows the player to jump to different

  developer: Capcom
  publisher: Capcom
  description:
    Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokémon, where the story takes place in the
    future on an island where a mysterious element called core has been discovered.
    This "core" element was used to create a highly advanced race of robots called
    Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the people of the
    island.  One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a
    very prominent member of the island.  The player then takes control of the son,
    Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal Walker in an attempt to
    hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father's death.
    .
    The gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the player explores various areas
    of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal
    Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these
    walkers, the player instead destroys them.  Destroying these other Walkers
    results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to
    upgrade or "evolve" Tetsuo's Walker into a more advanced form.  Additionally,
    the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be
    turned into capsules as well.  Additionally, capsules can not only contain
    power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.
    .
    The battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling
    attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, if a player
    fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at
    one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple
    hits on multiple opponents.
    .
    There are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in
    Pokémon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine
    walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can
    also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring
    the health of the players Walker.
    .
    As the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100
    different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as
    bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island.
    Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even
    exchange their base camps.

    If you've got a keen eye and a quick trigger finger, you might just have what it
    takes to become the next great hunter. Using a wide array of weaponry that
    ranges from rifles to bows to muzzleloaders, you'll search all sorts of scenery
    in pursuit of your prey. Journeying through the treacherous mountains of
    Colorado, deep into the expanses of Montana, and through the deserts of New
    Mexico, you'll have to keep your eyes peeled if you want to get the jump on
    these wily critters. There are plenty of animals out there, but each has
    realistic movements and behavior to evade your efforts. The big game creatures
    at large include deer, bighorn sheep, elk, and bears. Of course, you'll have
    access to the requisite calls, attractants, and cover scents, but don't expect
    any of these intelligent beasts to fall right into your traps. You'll have to
    use your brains, reflexes, instinct, and some basic perseverance to help bag you
    a trophy kill. In ROCKY MOUNTAIN TROPHY HUNTER, you won't have to worry about
    strapping a dead animal to your car roof!

    Hanasaka Tenshi Tentenkun no Beat Breaker is a hybrid of the game Simon and a
    match-3 puzzle game.  Four buttons are required to play - left and right on the
    Control Pad, and the A and B buttons.  The game screen is split in half.  The
    top half contains eight columns, followed by a striped line, and then an empty
    white area.  To the left of the game screen is the time bar.  As you complete
    rounds, the bar increases.  When the bar reaches the top of the clock, the level
    is complete.  If your white area fills up beyond the striped lines, the game is
    over.
    .
    Each round has eight notes played in a specific rhythm.  After they are played,
    they play again, and this time, after each note is played, circles fall down the
    columns.  Your goal is to press a button when the circles hit the striped line,
    which turns them into colored circles with either arrows, A or B on them.  These
    then land in the bin.  If you miss hitting a note, the circles turn into black
    angry face circles, which are more difficult to clear.  Perform enough beats
    correctly and happy face circles will appear - these act as wildcards.
    .
    When three or more colored circles line up horizontally, they clear from the
    screen and points are scored.  While you could complete levels by simply
    pressing the same button in time over and over, the other buttons can be used to
    set up combos, allowing for bigger points.  In addition, if you press a note
    incorrectly, sometimes a different button symbol will fall instead, which you
    must then strategically try to clear.

    you must move and rotate a group of pieces that is stuck together. The goal is
    to get the moving pieces to stick together, forming a solid square of blocks.
    One that is done, the square disappears and the remaining pieces collapse
    inward, creating more room to maneuver. If you miss a piece, it will stick to
    the sides of the play area and cannot be removed. The game ends when the cluster
    of pieces becomes so big that it cannot fit into the screen. With 16 skill
    levels, the degree of challenge is always appropriate. If friends want to join
    the action, they can via a link cable. See how long you can last in KLUSTAR.

  description:
    In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying
    to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and
    behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.
    .
    The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each
    based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas
    (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a
    certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving
    over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the\n
    big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars
    brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting
    bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise
    the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that
    completing the next felony will gain even more points.
    .
    Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime,
    the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might
    give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the
    police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to
    find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs
    money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being
    arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail
    simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score
    multiplier being lowered.
    .
    The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while
    driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens
    large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which
    might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus
    items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and
    get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when
    busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with
    unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.

    Like many platform games you walk from left to right through a level. There are
    five different worlds which represent the surroundings of characters Yosemite
    Sam, Marvin the Martian, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and the Tasmanian Devil. Each
    world is divided into several levels. The object of each level is to find all
    film clapboards present.

    Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a mallet (or rolling pin for Lola).
    They also both feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can dig and move
    heavy chests and Lola can float down safely from large heights with her parasol.
    Players can switch between characters at any time.

    Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy required for special abilities,
    a super carrot that allows the player to fly like a helicopter (using his ears)
    and the habanero carrot, which makes the player invincible for a while.
    .
    If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level you get to play a small
    minigame where you have to shoot firecrackers at moving targets.
    .
    Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the major character of that world.
    Usually this involves running from a vehicle that pursues the player, while
    avoiding obstacles.

    Barbie Pet Rescue lets kids play with and care for a variety of domesticated
    animals. Visit Barbie and her kid sister Stacey at the Pet Rescue Center, where
    you'll wait for rescue missions, explore in the playrooms, or tend to pets in
    the Care Center.
    .
    Rescue missions come in over the phone or via e-mail; after learning which pet
    is missing where, travel with Barbie on her scooter to one of three different
    environments in which to search for one of eight lost pets. In many missions,
    you'll have to figure out how to entice scared animals to come to you, or how to
    retrieve pets trapped in trees or other sticky situations. If you get stuck
    yourself, Barbie will give you hints. With each successful mission, you'll
    receive a printable Paw & Purr Award that hangs on the Pet Rescue Center wall.
    .
    Rescued pets come back to the Pet Rescue Center with you and Barbie to wait for
    their owners and receive a little TLC. Nurse them back to health in the Care
    Center, where you'll give recovered pets water, treats, vitamins and grooming.
    You may also need to bandage a hurt leg or pick burrs from ruffled fur. After
    creating a file for them in the computer and giving them a name you select from
    a list of suggestions, the animals go to one of two playrooms to wait for their
    owners.
    .
    In the meantime, you can play with them, plus all the other pets already in the
    playroom--a kitten, bunny, hamster, puppy, and a turtle. Select which animal
    you'd like to pet, then use the cursor to stroke an animal's head or back or
    scratch it under the chin. The animals respond to your attention by licking,
    rolling over, purring, or barking.
    .
    There is a related mini-game for each kind of animal--Kitten Keepaway, Puppy
    Treat Toss, Hamster Trail, etc.--and if you do well enough, you'll see the
    animal perform a special trick. A few of the games require the use of logic and
    spatial aptitude, but for the most part they challenge the players' mouse
    mastery and hand-eye coordination.

    .
    Balloon Fight GB is notoriously rare, and it was distributed via the Nintendo

    Everyone in Mickey's home town was getting prepared for a big carnival!
    Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just finished all the carnival floats and was
    showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends.  However, spying from his
    creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group
    enjoying themselves.  Soon, he'd gathered his cronies and raced into town,
    swiping all the floats and decorations.  All that was left was a letter
    challenging them to a race to get their things back.

    Mickey's Racing Adventure is an adventure game that centers around isometric
    racing challenges in various worlds.  It's possible to play as Mickey and his
    friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey's town, earning money for car
    upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge
    Pete and his henchmen to various races.  For a fee, Magica de Spell will also
    conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your opponents.
    .
    The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play
    a special train mini-game.  Pete has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds,
    and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so that he

    by running into them before you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit.

    The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can't race himself, he can
    sniff around town and dig for secrets.  He'll also find hidden tunnels which let
    you play a Digger-like mini-game where you must either collect all the bones
    underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them.
    After completing the objective, Pluto must then head to the exit.

    by allowing you to send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared Communications

    The game features three distinct story campaigns, each pitting you against a
    different set of enemies which you must battle in classic Puyo Puyo fashion: In
    each stage you face off against an opponent in two different play areas, one for
    you and one for your opponent. As the blob-like "puyos" start falling in your
    play area, you must align them and create groups of the same color in order to
    clear the screen before you get flooded with puyos. Chaining puyos of different
    colors allows you to send several "garbage" puyos to the opposing player's play
    area in hopes of either flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever defeats
    the opposing player moves on to the next challenger.

    The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms,
    Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay
    and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WORMNET.
    .
    For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game
    Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot
    angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the
    enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not
    only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try
    to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep.
    .
    Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to
    the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you
    do.
    .
    Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an
    improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.

    slicks, banana peels, and more. Just be careful to avoid chomping plants,
    squirmy worms, bugs, bees, and butterflies along the way. Lola Bunny updates the
    action with humorous newscasts between levels as you run, jump, and fly your way
    to victory. You'll need quick, button-smashing reflexes and platform-hopping
    skills of the highest degree to save the kids in TWEETY'S HIGH-FLYING ADVENTURE.

    one? Then you may find DOGZ to be of interest. Part of the small but popular
    virtual pet genre, DOGZ lets you adopt a dog from one of three breeds:
    Chihuahua, Scottie, or mutt. You can play with the pet first to decide if it's
    right for you. Once you've adopted the little gal or fella, it's up to you to
    take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to
    grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your dog, though, your
    little pet will take off! Eventually, new breeds of dogs and new special toys
    will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can even trade
    toys and breeds of dogs with your friends via the infrared link.

    During a joyride in his biplane, the engine blows and Wario crashes into the

    figure, who strikes a deal with him. Find all of the missing Music boxes and he
    can leave. And any treasure he finds he can keep.
    .
    Much like Wario Land 2, Wario can't die from any attacks by the enemy. However
    he can change form after certain attacks, which can both help and halt his
    progress in each level. New forms of Wario include Invisible Wario and Ball of
    Yarn Wario (an un-controllable ball of yarn, with Wario inside).
    .
    Also, basic attacks such as swimming and the butt stomp don't become available
    to Wario until after completing a certain amount of levels, meaning you have to
    go back to completed levels to access other areas full of loot.

    try to gain altitude and get your opponent from above, collecting magical eggs
    for extra points. DEFENDER puts you in the pilot's seat of an aerodynamic space
    ship and shoots you through the expanses of a futuristic city under siege.
    You'll have to fend off other spacecraft, utilize a whole lot of impressive
    weaponry, and keep the civilians from turning into ugly mutants. Both games are
    notable for their influence over those to follow, and both are replicated in
    fine detail for the Game Boys Color. Challenge the computer, or link up and do

    To unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, young wizard Harry Potter must
    fight turn-based battles and solve quests. In this game, he is not alone, as a
    party system was added: his friends Ron and Hermione (and some other characters)
    will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use
    card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks
    and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in
    special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences
    combat through "lecture attacks", using helpful hints like "Be Careful!" (which
    increases defense, for example).
    .
    Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system,
    several other features were added: the Informous spell divulges information
    about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be accessed
    later. To aid in finding one's way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added.

  developer: Infogrames

  description:
    In Driver, the driving (pun intended) force of the world is crime. The main
    character, an ex-race car driver, takes on the role of an undercover cop. It
    seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He
    orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the
    inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level
    gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from
    San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will
    take place.
    .
    Basically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30
    different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided
    between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each
    require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the
    objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the
    primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the
    orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy
    become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on
    you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and
    intelligence.
    .
    Driver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the
    player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do
    anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city
    with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway
    mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game
    places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to
    avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to
    impede your progress.
    .
    Driver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind. It offers a password save
    system to keep your data under wraps.

  description:
    While exploring her house's attic, the little witch Wendy discovers a treasure
    chest.  Upon opening it, magical stones are released from their prison, and head
    to a castle which is suspended in the sky. The power of the stones upsets
    gravity, and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right on top of Wendy's
    house!  It's up to Wendy to set things right again!
    .
    Wendy: Every Witch Way is a combination of a side-scrolling platformer and a
    puzzle game.  As Wendy, players explore the castle in search of the troublesome
    stones that have upset gravity.  Wendy has the ability to control gravity
    herself – by pressing up or down on the control pad while jumping, Wendy will
    cause gravity to reverse in that direction.  Most enemies and obstacles in the
    game world are also affected by the gravity switching – you'll need to
    manipulate gravity frequently to progress through the game's different puzzles.
    .
    Stars can be used to power up Wendy's magic.  For every star that she collects
    (to a maximum of five), her magic will increase.  Beginning with a small weak
    shot, you can power your magic up to a spread shot that fires in three
    directions.  The stars also act as Wendy's health meter – if you get hit, you'll
    lose a star, as well as some magical power.  Get hit when you have no stars
    left, and you'll lose a life.
    .
    At the end of every world, there is a short bonus stage with Wendy riding on her
    broomstick.  In these stages, you must attack enemies and collect stars as Wendy
    automatically flies to the next world.

    Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing
    matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as
    either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling.
    .
    Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can
    train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going
    shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work
    to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter
    activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.
    .
    In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by
    getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic
    pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate
    your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without
    prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want
    from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is
    a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The
    rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your
    shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your
    own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a
    small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with
    a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a
    good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you
    breed and with whom.
    .
    During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in
    between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You
    can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches
    are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out
    before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the
    most health at the end of the match.

    manager game, O'Leary Manager 2000.
    .
    The gameplay in O'Leary Manager 2000 is not only about the management aspects of
    football. It's a bit similar to Sensible World of Soccer, as you can play not
    only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an top-down view
    similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties.
    .
    In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European
    countries. As the manager you get to lay up training schedules, buy and sell
    players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of statistics.
    The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or
    a text-based interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights
    shown in the top-down view. If you don't want to play through the whole season,
    you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode
    also supports multiple players.

  description:
    After much acclaim for your past farming accomplishments (as part of the
    previous Harvest Moon titles on GBC), you are asked by a young girl to help her
    get her farm up and running. The farm, situated on an island, needs plenty of
    work, so you need all your skills to get things working correctly.
    .
    Your many tasks range from tending to the farm animals, keeping an eye on the
    budget while purchasing goods (food, water, mechanical items, etc) at the local
    stores, and so forth. And although the main aim is to build and maintain the
    farm, there are plenty of opportunities to take care of yourself (go to the
    movies, buy pets, find a girlfriend/boyfriend).

    weight and can decide to "hit" or "hold". If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose.
    .
    The player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable
    fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. Once
    a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When
    you do so you must make sure your line doesn't break by keeping an eye on the
    tension.
    .
    Weather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of
    catching a fish. Each type of lure also improves the odds in specific types of
    water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the legendary
    Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.

    gaming community. Yes, this is Scrabble for Game Boy Color.
    .
    Visually, there's really not much to say about this Game Boy Color version. The
    game consists of a series of white tiles each with their own letter and value.
    Is that enough for you? Oh yes. You know Scrabble. Seven random letters, make a
    word out of 'em, score points. Fall out with opponent optional.
    .
    Seven lettered tiles it is then, with which you must formulate the highest
    scoring word possible. Clearly, letters such as Q, X and Z have a greater value,
    but the number of legitimate words that use these letters is limited. Once
    you've chosen your word, you must place it on a board in a horizontal or
    vertical fashion. Certain spaces on the board contain score boosters that will
    increase the value of your chosen word. Triple Word Score is particularly
    useful. Your letter supply will then be replenished and you must repeat the
    process once your opponent has placed his word on the board. At the end of the
    game, when the supply of tiles is exhausted, the highest scoring player wins.

  game: Astérix : Search for Dogmatix
  file: Asterix - Sur la Trace D'Idefix (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl).zip
  developer: Infogrames
  publisher: Infogrames
  description:
    Asterix and Obelix (based on the French comic book series), must embark on a
    journey from the forests of France to the coliseums of Rome. Their goal is to
    find Obelix's lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or
    Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels
    in this side-scrolling adventure game.
    .
    This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in
    which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select
    screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix,
    players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are
    found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become
    available from the title-screen under the "Instant Fun" option. They vary from a
    "Memory" style shield-matching game to humorous events such as "Throw a Roman
    Mini Game".
    .
    Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and
    limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas
    Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably
    slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the
    stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers,
    boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to
    collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it
    is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the
    purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).

    spots to create its own unique atmosphere. Each board contains eight mini-games
    that differ from simple actions to more complex objectives. The game also comes

    contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a
    different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as
    its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen.
    The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game's arcade
    feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and
    how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the

    In 2000 Ubi Soft released two David O'Leary-licensed games. One, David O'Leary's
    Total Soccer 2000,  based on the PC game with the same name. The other one was a
    manager game, O'Leary Manager 2000.
    .
    The gameplay in O'Leary Manager 2000 is not only about the management aspects of
    football. It's a bit similar to Sensible World of Soccer, as you can play not
    only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an top-down view
    similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties.
    .
    In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European
    countries. As the manager you get to lay up training schedules, buy and sell
    players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of statistics.
    The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or
    a text-based interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights
    shown in the top-down view. If you don't want to play through the whole season,
    you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode
    also supports multiple players.

    Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next
    to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in
    this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen
    shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear
    and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and
    prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In
    Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they
    must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the
    amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.
    .
    Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one
    another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player's success
    results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must
    clear.

  description:
    A mix between classic "Walls" and "Bubbles" puzzles games\n
    12 characters to challenge\n
    12 gems to win\n
    Intense competitions\n
    4 amazing game modes
    .
    The general objective of Puchi Carat is to destroy gem-like blocks using a ball
    and paddle. Gems "fall in" from the top of the play area one line at a time and
    are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically. Hitting a gem
    with the ball will destroy it, and if the destroyed gem causes other gems to no
    longer be connected to the top of the play area, they fall off, scoring bonus
    points. Destroying a special flashing gem also destroys all regular gems of the
    same color in the playfield. There are also metallic blocks that take more than
    one hit to destroy.
    .
    The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the playfield, which can move left
    and right to bounce the ball back upward. Unlike in most other Breakout-style
    games, missing the ball does not cost a life or end the game, but rather adds
    more lines of gems to the top of the playfield. Gem lines will advance on their
    own after a certain amount of time, as well as when the playfield is cleared
    entirely or drops below a certain number of gems. If the gems advance across the
    line at the bottom of the playfield where the paddle resides, the player loses
    and the game is over.
    .
    The arcade version of Puchi Carat features three main gameplay modes: A
    single-player mode where the goal is to clear a certain number of gem lines, a
    story mode in which the player challenges each character in a head-to-head
    battle (where dropped gems are added to the opponent's playfield from the
    bottom), and a two-player versus mode following the same rules as the story
    mode. Each of the single-player modes offers three levels of difficulty. Various
    ports of the game offer additional gameplay modes (such as time-attack mode),
    more difficulty levels, and expanded storylines for each character.

    others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers,

    Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly.
    For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with
    a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther.
    On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run
    really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a
    shield against frontal attacks.

    The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels.
    Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and
    lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of
    a minor enemy.

    As time is being torn apart by evil forces, there is only one force powerful
    enough to stop it: the Power Rangers! In POWER RANGERS TIME FORCE for the Game
    Boy Color, you take the role of the color-coordinated heroes and fight the good
    fight. The game plays out in 2D battles and side-scrolling action in two
    different ways: you will be forced to battle enemies in human form, and you'll
    also have to band together and become a Megazord to take down the most powerful
    bosses. Each character offers several different attributes and statistics, so
    choosing the right Ranger is critical. There are 15 levels in all, each coming
    with a different theme. You'll take the Power Rangers everywhere from pyramids
    to space environments as you fight to save the world. POWER RANGERS TIME FORCE
    is a great adventure across time and space, and it's sure to please fans of both
    side-scrolling games and the numerous incarnations of the television show.

  description:
    Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you
    are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the
    Pacific during World War II.
    .
    It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun
    nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be
    bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out the
    concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the
    Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese
    battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.
    .
    .
    You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have
    to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of
    fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to
    your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.
    .
    The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You
    no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard
    jeeps & trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and
    the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane
    like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission.
    Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.

    Rather than offering a standard football game, NFL BLITZ 2000 changes the rules
    a little. The game is played seven-on-seven, and it takes 30-yards to get a
    first down. But probably the most important rule change is that there are no
    penalties. When you start the game, you have the choice of playing in the Arcade
    or Season mode. Arcade has you pick a team and try to defeat all of the other
    teams in the league, while in the Season mode, you take your team through the
    grueling NFL season in hopes of making the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl.
    No matter how you play the game, you will not miss a second of the action,
    thanks to three different camera angles. Try to keep your helmet on while
    playing NFL BLITZ 2000.

    The object of the game is to score points by dropping balls onto sets of
    see-saws, in rows of three or more of the same colour. The twist, however, is
    that each ball has a different weight, determined by the number written on the
    front of it. The higher the number, the heavier the ball. This means that if a
    ball is placed onto one side of the see-saw which is heavier than the total
    value of the balls on the other side, the balance would be upset, sending the
    top ball flying across the playing field to land on another column. Cascade
    'throws' can be achieved, and the game is over if a column reaches too tall. A
    variety of bonus balls, all with special uses, also feature.

    Following the success of the original PlayStation edition of Resident Evil in
    1996, Capcom expanded the game in a number of ports - one of those planned was
    for the GameBoy Color. In 1999, HotGen Studios, Ltd., a company in the United
    Kingdom, was selected by Capcom to port the game.
    .
    HotGen designed the game to be a direct-conversion of the PlayStation version
    following the same single-player paths as other versions with options to play as
    either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. New additions were also planned
    including a greater variety in enemies and the ability to disarm traps. A new
    save feature was also in development, removing the need for Ink Ribbons and
    finding save points.
    .
    However, after sending the finished product to Capcom for evaluation, the
    company turned it away. Their official statement in 2000 claimed that they were
    "not confident that the product would have made both consumers and Capcom
    happy."

  description:
    Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center
    is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the
    turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link
    mode is also supported.
    .
    Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram,
    etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another
    shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played
    piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the
    strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a
    bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will
    contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the
    remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any
    remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are
    subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)
    .
    In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been
    released as a board game.

    exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many points as you

    attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls
    of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen),
    which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the
    next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of
    sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You'll listen to five

  description:
    The Game Boy Color version of the original Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six game scales
    back the 3D visuals of the original game in favor of an almost top-down view,
    but builds on the same premise of the player controlling a member of the Rainbow
    counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving hostage situations and
    neutralizing threats, in sixteen missions.
    .
    The limitations of the platform are not traded in for an arcade-like approach.
    Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics.
    After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the
    role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with
    different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression
    and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills
    including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of
    weapons. They can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the
    operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six different
    handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including
    heartbeat sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away,
    but that is not sufficient for later missions. In the planning mode, the last
    part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on
    the map and determine the course of action.
    .
    The actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak
    around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a
    tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to
    the computer version.

    Babe the Pig, of the eponymous movies, was raised by sheepdogs and, hence,
    believes himself to be a "sheep-pig", who herds sheep as his foster parents do.
    In this game, you control the plucky little porker and direct his sheep
    management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated,
    frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their
    movement is halted or altered should their course intercept an obstacle such as
    a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline.
    .
    Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of
    his feature films, and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the calm
    pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its sequel.  While
    the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the
    material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise
    put, "that'll do, pig."

  game: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
  file: Tony Hawk's Skateboarding ~ Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (USA, Europe).zip
  developer: Activision
  publisher: Activision
  description:
    This is the first handheld version of Tony Hawk's popular skateboarding game. It
    bears little resemblance to the original Playstation version. It is actually
    composed of two different events, a half pipe and a race mode.
    .
    Half pipe mode is viewed from a side perspective, kind of like the classic Skate
    or Die game. You perform tricks to achieve a high score. Race mode is viewed
    from a top-down perspective, where you goal is to perform tricks and get to the
    end quickly.

  game: Bomberman Max : Red Challenger

  developer: Vatical Entertainment
  publisher: Vatical Entertainment
  description:
    The second half of the Bomberman Max series, Red Challenger is much the same as
    Blue Champion in terms of the tasks at hand for the main character. However,
    instead of playing as Bomberman, you play as Max, who still is much the same as
    Bomberman except for looks. The graphics are also slightly different for each
    level compared to Blue.
    .
    The task stays the same, plant bombs to destroy blocks and enemies in your way,
    as well as collecting Charabombs, creatures who act much the same as Pokémon
    where you raise the Charabombs and fight against other players. Certain
    Charabombs and levels are only available in Blue, so you must link with another
    Game Boy and the Blue Champion Edition to collect all of the Charabombs and
    complete the adventure.
