  developer: Nintendo

  description:
    Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES Play Action Football.  While
    Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of
    the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the
    appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989
    season.  You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB,
    RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.
    .
    Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a
    three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the
    bottom left to upper right of the screen.  Each team has 12 passing and 12
    running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively
    gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays
    and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a
    fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.
    .
    Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There
    are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field
    goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in
    audio) whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are displayed on a summary
    screen after every quarter of play.  Highest scoring team wins, which in
    playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning
    it all in the Power Bowl!

  description:
    T&C Surf Designs features both skateboarding and surfing games. The skating
    section (called Street Skate Session) is a side scrolling action game where you
    need to navigate through an obstacle course within the given time limit. Ideally
    you want to earn as many points as possible by performing tricks, jumping over
    items, and collecting bonuses. If you crash too many times (or fall into a hole,
    run out of time, etc...) then the game will be over. In the surfing section
    (called Big Wave Encounter) you need to surf a giant wave all the way to the
    beach. As with skating, you can earn points by performing tricks and collecting
    bonuses; likewise the game ends if you crash too many times. You can choose to
    play either game individually, or alternate between the two (the Wood & Water
    Rage option). You can select several T&C Surf Designs characters to play as,
    including Thrilla Gorilla, Kool Kat, Joe Cool, and Tiki Man.

  description:
    In the early 1880's in Texas, a man has returned to bring  justice to the outlaw
    who murdered his brother and his former comrades, the Texas Rangers. His name is
    the Lone Ranger. The outlaw, whose name is Butch Cavendish, has now kidnapped
    the President. The time has come for the masked man to begin his journey of
    adventure for the purpose of safely rescuing the President and avenging the
    deaths of his brother and former comrades.
    .
    The game takes you through 8 western-themed regions, each\n
    with a different objective, all of which brings you closer to your nemesis,
    Butch Cavendish. The game features many points of view during gameplay. Most of
    the time, the game is played from a top-down perspective, as you travel through
    the country and walk through towns. At other times, the game switches to a side
    scrolling view when you are in a boss stage. On occasion, the view switches to a
    first person perspective and plays similar to a first person shooter.
    .
    Each bad guy you kill is worth money. You can use money to buy more bullets,
    dynamite, rifles or a patch up from a doctor. For example, you start with a
    short barreled gun which you can upgrade to either a medium or long barreled
    gun. Your gun shoots standard bullets but can also fire silver bullets which are
    stronger than the standard ones.

    that side extra funds which can be used to build new units at factories and
    shipyards.

    The golden warpship was once the most powerful ship in the galactic fleet. But
    the ship was captured by aliens, and its parts scattered throughout twelve
    different worlds. On each world deadly aliens, booby traps, black holes, and
    extreme gravitational forces guard the parts. It is now up to Solar Jetman to

    At the beginning of each world, Solar Jetman starts out at the mother ship and
    explores using a jetpod. When a part of the golden warpship or something else of
    use is located, the jetpod can be used to haul it back to the mother ship. The
    mother ship will move on to the next world when all the parts on the current
    world have been brought back. If the jetpod takes too much damage, Solar Jetman

    sequel to the classic beat 'em up/rpg hybrid Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari aka
    River City Ransom.
    .
    The game takes place in the Edo period of Japan, making it a prequel really, as
    you take control of an ancestor of Kunio (also named Kunimasa) tasked with
    saving the life of his ill friend. Kunimasa must traverse the Japanese
    countryside beating the collection of gang members and other assorted baddies in
    the same way as in River City Ransom. Each location is represented by a side
    scrolling level filled with enemies, which you must take down using a collection
    of attacks and special moves that can be purchased from shops scattered through
    the levels.
    .
    The game uses the same engine and Super-Deformed character design, only changing
    the sprites to reflect the new setting. Unlike RCR, you can freely select which
    stage to tackle at any time, making it a more non-linear experience. And while
    money is still used to buy items, weapons and moves, you now also gain
    experience directly by defeating enemies, which is used to enhance Kunio's base
    stats.
    .
    A two-player mode is available and, even if you play the game solo, the game
    provides help in the form of an AI-controlled partner who can be change as you
    gain more allies  thorough the game (including former enemies).

    setting up deals and procuring more money. Also, the party operates in battle as

    on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To
    retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes.
    Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block
    with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the
    block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to
    travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some
    blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some
    completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items
    can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need
    to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path
    permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze
    (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering
    about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and
    eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze

    The peaceful island Coolmint is attacked by flame monsters sent by the evil
    wizard Druidle. The queen of the winter fairies chooses the novice wizard Dana
    to drive back the monsters.
    .
    Fire 'n Ice is a puzzle game seen from a side-view perspective. The goal in each
    level is to extinguish all flames by pushing or dropping blocks onto them. The
    player takes control of Dana who can create or destroy ice blocks, climb blocks
    and push loose blocks. Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction
    that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed.
    However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a
    flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks
    next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an
    ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning
    it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create
    ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides
    above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to
    extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when
    pushed (unless they are on an icy surface).

    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade differs from the two other games with the
    same name as it is a hybrid of various genres such as platform action,
    motorcycle racing, puzzle solving and even some adventure elements.
    .
    In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you play Indy's role in his search for the
    Holy Grail, but this time it is you who chooses which step he will take at each
    part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about
    the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a
    telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship
    called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what
    you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go
    to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.
    .
    In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to
    different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres.
    For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have
    to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle.
    Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch,
    kick, walk, run, jump and use his whip.

    career. This game plays lake a standard baseball nine (or 5 – 8 if you wish)
    innings baseball game. There are three difficulty levels giving access to
    players at all still levels. When pitching you are given 5 different pitch types
    that pitcher chooses by pressing the correct directional button before the
    pitch, therefore keeping it hidden from your opponent. Batting is done the same
    way but the type of hit is chosen as the batter hits the ball.
    .
    At any moment, base sneaking can be made (by the batter) or stopped (by the
    pitcher). Fielding is only done using the CPU, but once the fielder gets the
    ball then you must choose what base to throw to using the directional buttons.
    All of the teams are just city names and players, all with different stats, are
    fictional except for Bo Jackson himself who is hidden in the game.

  description:
    The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed
    early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and
    dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! "Lettuce check it
    out," urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. "I yam King
    Kale," he says, "Won't you peas peas help me?" Yes, the flaccid puns start to
    fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those
    expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game
    programmer before.
    .
    It seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being
    dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis,
    right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way,
    Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even
    managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of
    cute robots and "vegetable-themed" guardian minions, the latter of which are
    vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same
    pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at
    the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new
    leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to
    Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot
    twist.
    .
    Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by
    the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each
    world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include
    the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet,
    black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the
    Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle
    with Vegetron takes place.

  description:
    This soccer game was made at the time when Nintendo introduced their four player
    adapter, and was probably made for the four playing purpose. This is shown
    clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between
    many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the
    replayability.
    .
    When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer
    countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the
    first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you
    lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.
    .
    In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the
    match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass,
    tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is
    totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the
    referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.

  game: Puzznic

  developer: Nintendo
  publisher: Nintendo
  description:
    The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into
    place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the
    same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right,
    which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.
    .
    There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms
    meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular
    order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd
    number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of
    the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making
    contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter
    blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements
    meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move
    possible (by forming a stack, for example)
    .
    The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four
    levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an
    expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level
    3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in
    the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either
    by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible
    position) loses one of your 3 lives.

    uses a machine gun to stage an assault on a tropical island that's home to a
    cyborg army. In this NES port, the player can use either a gamepad or the NES
    Light Zapper to carry out the mission. Battle through numerous stages beginning
    with an approach to the island. This first stage is held over the water and
    features at attack on a number of small gunboats, a helicopter, and an entire
    battleship. As the player progresses through the stages of the island, the human
    (and even canine) enemies are revealed to be robots when the flesh is destroyed.
    At various junctures of the game, the player is allowed to choose which game
    path to pursue.
    .
    While the arcade version of Mechanized Attack had a miniature machine gun
    replica for the player to use, this NES adaptation attempts to reproduce the
    feel by allowing the player to hold down a game pad button or the Light Zapper
    trigger for automatic fire. Extra ammo is plentiful so be sure to fire at those
    power-up boxes to grab as much as you can. There are also more powerful grenades

    game, different from the interactive movie gameplay common to the other games
    under the same license.
    .
    Once again, Dirk is up to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Singe. To
    do so, Dirk will use weapons such knifes, axes, fire balls, etc, thrown against
    dragons, bats, snakes, the Lizard King (who will steal gold from him), among
    other foes. He will also do a lot of jumping and ducking to avoid threats along
    his way, such as falling bridges, presses, spikes and holes on the floor. To
    complete a stage, all he has to do is to get to the end of it alive.
    .
    At the end of some stages, Dirk will take an elevator that will lead him to
    other stages. The elevator makes short stops at some platforms, and you have to
    decide if Dirk will jump onto that platform or another. If  he takes the wrong
    platform, he may go back to a previous stage and go through it all over again.
    From the elevator Dirk can also get to a bonus level, the Lizard King's throne
    room, where he can try to recover the gold the King has stolen from him.
    .
    Although Dirk has a life bar, he will instantly die if takes damage from the
    most of the threats. He also has a "candle bar", which is used (by pressing the
    start button) to light up dark places and to discover hidden items at specific
    locations.
    .
    The game can be played by 2 players taking turns. The PAL version has faster
    gameplay, additional enemies (including level bosses), death animations and
    splash screens in between the levels.

    My Life My Love: Boku no Yume Watashi no Negai (or "My Life My Love: My Dreams
    My Desires") is a board style game for the Famicom. This is a board game for one
    player (no human or computer opponents). You start as an angel in heaven. Your
    number is drawn at random, which means that you are the next angel to be
    delivered to Earth to become a human being. You start as a child and live your
    whole life (dying at 100). Throughout the game, you will do your best to improve
    your statistics in six categories: knowledge, health, friendship, love,
    popularity and wealth. You will be ranked among the Japanese population to see
    how well you are doing in six categories. Japan has a population of 130 million.
    You will then start at #130,000,000 and try to get to #1. The entire course is
    very long. You can expect to play it for about 50 hours, and that's as long as
    you win on the first try. You will not do this on your own. Reaching #1 in the
    ranking is not easy.

    Quattro Arcade is an collection of 4 action arcade games, all of which feature
    single and 2-player modes.
    .
    1. C.J.'s Elephant Antics: C.J. the elephant went and got himself caught in an
    elephant trap. One thing led to another and the next thing you know, he's in a
    Parisian zoo. He makes a break for it and vows to make his way back home to
    Africa, traveling through Paris, Switzerland, and Egypt in order to reach his
    destination. This game is a side-scrolling action game. Offensively, C.J. can
    toss bombs at myriad enemies in his path. He also has a parachute that allows
    him to glide safely down from great heights. 2 players can play this game
    cooperatively as 2 differently colored C.J. characters.
    .
    2. Stunt Buggies: this game involves 1 or 2 players piloting buggies around
    dangerous mazes filled with renegade buggies on a quest to collect all the bombs
    in order to escape the maze.
    .
    3. F-16 Renegade: your crazy professor has hacked into the US Air Force's
    computers and programmed all of the jets to fly off and start World War III.
    Since no one will believe your tale on this matter, you take it upon yourself to
    follow your professor's footsteps: you hack into the USAF computers yourself but
    to locate the F-16 training program so that you can then break into the air base
    and heist a jet in order to take down all of the malevolent computer-controlled
    jets. The action in this game consists of flying a jet and shooting other jets.
    However, the perspective alternates from overhead scrolling (odd levels) to 3rd
    person view from behind the jet (even levels). Powerups come in the form of
    stronger weapons, smart bombs, and extra lives. The game also features a
    2-player competitive mode.
    .
    4. Go! Dizzy Go!: Dizzy's nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks, has abducted Dizzy's
    friends. Thus, the task falls to Dizzy to rescue them. To do this, he must
    collect fruit in a variety of dangerous mazes scattered throughout several
    worlds including an underwater realm, forest realm, a pyramid, a mountain, and a
    castle. Additionally, 2 players can team up to conquer the mazes.
    .
    All of the games feature 2-player modes. This is an unlicensed NES game.

    who can turn dream into reality and create magical worlds where he helps people
    and fights the evil.
    .
    Some time ago, Giga Zombie revived dead kings in order to conquer the world.
    Doraemon and his friends fought the evil being, but were trapped in a magical
    portal, and ended up in different time periods. In this game, the nameless hero
    (you can choose to be either male or female) must help Doraemon to find his
    friends and to save the world once again.
    .
    The game is a traditional top-down RPG with turn-based party combat viewed from
    first person perspective. The unusual part is the time traveling. You and your
    party can travel to different time periods, change the present and discover many
    secrets.

    very similar to Shin Megami Tensei (NES) and is one of the few games of this
    genre to be available on this console.\n
    Originally, Shadow Brain was sold with a VHS tape detailing the story behind the
    game. The game has a Sci-Fi story behind it, decent graphics and nice music.
    Shadow Brain seems like a very solid alternative to Shin Megami Tensei.

    evil empire. Only four young warriors could escape, three men and one girl. On
    their way to a neighbor town Altea, they were attacked by the Dark Knights.
    Three of them were brought safely to Altea by the order of the rebel army. But
    one has not yet been found...
    .
    Final Fantasy II (not to be mistaken with Final Fantasy IV, released in USA as
    "Final Fantasy II"), like its predecessor, is a top-down role-playing game where
    you travel through the overworld, fighting baddies and buying things and resting
    in cities. It features round-based combat (you input menu commands for the whole
    party, and then watch the combat round unfold). It has an unusual
    character-building system: there are no classes and also no levels, but
    characters grow stronger by performing the same action over and over. Get hit a
    lot and your HP will increase; cast more spells and your intelligence will raise
    (but your physical power might decrease), and so on. Weapons and spells, on the
    other side, can be leveled up. The more you use a certain type of level, the
    more proficient the character who uses this weapon becomes; the more you cast a
    certain magic spell, the more damage it does.

    collect ten puppies. Several enemies roam the streets and the twins can throw
    punches or even baseballs at them in order to defend themselves. Defeating
    enemies increases the twins energy counter. Their energy also acts as a
    currency. They can and must spend their energy on certain items they find at
    shops. Only certain items can be used to beat the boss monsters who are holding
    the puppies captive. The twins will also need to locate certain shops to discard
    of items they no longer need as they each can only carry a handful of items at a
    time.

    targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the

    Win, Lose or Draw was a popular TV show requiring artistic skills and an ability
    to think laterally. A player on your team draws something on the big game board,

    depicted literally, such as 'bright idea' showing a light bulb over somebody's
    head, and 'cabin fever' as a rickety building next to a man with a thermometer
    in his mouth.
    .
    In this computerised implementation the drawing phase of the game is handled by
    the computer, so your task is simply to guess the meaning of the picture by
    thinking laterally. Your team has 60 seconds, and you can guess repeatedly, but
    the picture takes time to take shape. If you fail to guess correctly, the
    opposition has 15 seconds to guess it (with a single try) to steal the money.

    One of several Mahjong solitaire games released by Sachen. Mahjong Trap - Si
    Cuan Ma Que is based on the popular solitaire game Mahjong Tiles, a game adapted
    by Joseph Babcock to the United States around the end of the First World War.
    However, Mahjong did originate in China, but its adaptation in the 1920s spread
    like wildfire across Britain, the United States, and Australia, among other
    countries. Hacker International's version, Shisen Mahjong - Seifuku Hen, has
    added erotic themes. In the game the player(s) tackle six difficulty levels with
    three levels in each that reveal their own set of erotic images upon completion
    of each stage. The game's notable in that it features voice clips (although low
    quality) and is very difficult, partially due to the lackluster programming.
    There's a two-player mode in the game where if a connection isn't made in time,
    a sound clip will play and the other player will take control. This is probably
    the best way to tackle the game, considering how complex the puzzles get.

    In Back to the Future, 80s teen Marty McFly is mistakenly send 30 years into the
    past where he disrupts his own parents from meeting. Faced with extinction at
    the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future
    parents and make it back to his own time.
    .
    LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal
    race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the
    player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s
    Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path,
    including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera
    scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and
    away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The
    player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's
    photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from
    existence.
    .
    Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling
    milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his
    mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The
    final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the
    DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as
    lightning bolts instead of clocks).

    weapons are level specific such as a sword and lance in the medieval level and a

    Dr. Evil has kidnapped the scientist Jenny Aykroyd and it's the Ultimate
    Stuntman's job to rescue her.
    .
    Ultimate Stuntman must fight through 7 worlds with 4 stages each and then
    through the final world which consists of 3 stages. The game has a variety of
    different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage,
    a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb
    disposal stage.
    .
    The overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a
    dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You
    must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides
    the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts
    to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to
    either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a
    boss battle.
    .
    Sometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect
    extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles.
    Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.
    .
    The side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a
    platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set
    number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other
    consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying
    not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.
    .
    The climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with
    a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of
    the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an
    android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android
    boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action.
    The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets
    into them.
    .
    In the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all
    the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each
    other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to
    chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a
    certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like
    scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try
    again with less time.

    In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must
    rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced
    pirate.
    .
    Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each
    level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak
    brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage
    is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all
    enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown
    at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned
    either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy
    projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy
    projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun.
    After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for
    extra points.
    .
    In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly,
    drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and
    eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this
    message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage
    will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing
    fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit
    kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus
    stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.
    .
    As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A
    new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of
    its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the
    previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a
    spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion
    and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for
    the next few levels, and so on.
    .
    Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any
    give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another
    ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a
    transient effect.
    .
    The items in this game are:
    .
    1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he
    can get behind even the most cunning kami.
    .
    2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at

    3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja
    stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.

    4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if
    not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.
    .
    5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give
    different point valuations.\n
    2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!
    .
    6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the
    player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will
    surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.
    .
    7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three
    different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.

    Hanna-Barbera. In this spin-off adventure, George Jetson is tasked my his
    employer to put a stop to the profit-making schemes of the rival Cogswell's
    company. To do this, George must hop from location to location in his jet and
    conquer each level using the resources available to him, as well as with the
    assistance of the other Jetson franchise characters.
    .
    Cogswell's Caper is a side-scrolling action game where George Jetson can walk,
    crouch, and jump (actually, he's too lazy to jump and a jet pack handles the
    jumping duty for short bursts). Each level is littered with crates and other
    items that George can pick up and toss at enemies, while finding useful items
    (and occasionally even more enemies) underneath them. Since the game is set in
    the futuristic world of the Jetsons, there are also copious switches on walls
    which activate all kinds of features of the surroundings, such as a switch that
    reverses gravity for a brief time.

    Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is
    simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft
    has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns).
    In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all
    the time.

    spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a
    friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

    Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of
    pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many
    of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are
    seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners
    rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the
    flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered
    from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece
    can't flow into, the pipe is finished.
    .
    Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position,
    the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down
    anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and
    complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled.
    Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it
    easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.
    .
    Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5
    cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen.
    Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the
    side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After
    every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only
    place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board
    game of "Connect 4".

    player's future, based on their year of birth. Though fortune-telling devices
    weren't unheard of, this was the first NES "game" to provide such a service. It
    would, however, be followed almost immediately with Induction Produce's '89
    Dennou Kyuusei Uranai; another fortune-telling interactive simulator.
    .
    The player can choose to receive their fortune in distinct areas of their lives,
    including romantic prospects, the best time to marry their partner and the
    outcome of their future business dealings. Due to the minimal impact and
    relative obscurity of Eastern horoscopes in the west, the game was never
    released outside of Japan, though the US would eventually receive their own
    equivalent with Taboo: The Sixth Sense.

    "areas", which look like planets. The various locations range from deserts to
    jungles and from oceans to industrial zones, featuring many different types of
    enemies.
    .
    Zanac's unique artificial intelligence program can intensify the action based
    upon your level of skill. The better you are, the more powerful "The System".
    Examples of the A.I. (but not limited to) in this game: the enemies are
    generally coming randomly with their behavior based on factors like the position
    your ship in the screen, the place you last died; the shoot speed of the enemies
    and bosses do also vary.
    .
    At the end of each area (level) you'll have to fight the area boss. Area bosses
    are mainly based around huge, screen-filling bunker bases consisting of gun
    turrets and a "core". You have limited time for fighting against the area boss -
    a time out could mean failure in entering the next stage, and with the time
    running, more and more enemies were attacking as penalty.

    mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore,
    should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up
    his attacks.

    movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. Enemies reduce health by
    varying amounts, health can be restored by increasing the player's score. The

    Wagyan Land 2 plays pretty much identically to the first Wagyan Land. You're a
    cute green lizard dinosaur thing, and you walk to the right and shoot various
    syllables out of your mouth, which don't actually hurt enemies. They just remain
    frozen for a certain period of time, depending on how powered-up your attack is.
    Once you get four power-ups you become invincible, and you can finally kill the
    damned things. Which doesn't happen often.
    .
    So, how can you defeat the bosses with a crappy syllable that can't hurt
    anybody? Why you play minigames with them, of course! The whole game's pretty
    frustrating, with the whole ?one-hit-and-you-start-the-entire-level-over? thing
    that's so popular in the world of videogaming. Honestly, it's fun and all, but I
    don't understand why the game needed to have two sequels.
    .
    While this isn't quite as polished as AlanMidas's translation of the first
    Wagyan Land game (the title screen, for instance, and the GYA syllables that he
    shoots out are left in Japanese), it's still all in English, and pretty damn fun
    to play. You can just pretend those projectiles are magical, uh, runes, or
    something.
    .
    July 2009 Update\n
    The translation is incomplete. Another ending was left untranslated and was even
    removed if the patch is used (as the author's notes state so). The unofficial

    This 2D platformer has elements of role-playing and adventure in addition to
    side-scrolling action.
    .
    The story is a classic one of good versus evil.  Disaster strikes the once
    peaceful Elf town of Eolis. The sky rains meteorites upon the World Tree - wild
    animals and evil monsters terrorize the citizens - the water supply from the
    wells is dwindling - plants are withering - people are dying. Only you can
    restore peace to the land by conquering the Evil One, who lives in the Evil
    Place.
    .
    There are many places you must visit during your quest including the medieval
    town, where you begin, country villages, fortresses, caves, and gloomy bogs -
    each with its own ambiance and musical score.  You will be talking with the
    villagers, collecting gold to buy weapons, armor and other objects, jumping over
    obstacles and using items.  Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil
    gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and
    daggers or zap them with a magic spell.
    .
    As areas are completed by defeating enemies, your character rises up in “levels”
    and achieves a new “rank” which is tied directly to the restore password (called
    a “mantra” in the game). The higher your “rank”, the more gold you start out
    with.  Saving a game can only be done in a shrine or temple with a priest.  This
    is also where you are transported when you restart the game - or if you die.

  game: M.U.L.E.

  developer: Mindscape
  publisher: Mindscape
  description:
    M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin
    planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore,
    Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food,
    you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your
    output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a
    shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your
    game.
    .
    You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder.
    There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6
    turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest
    level.
    .
    Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for
    themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with
    less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for
    producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden
    and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.
    .
    After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do
    other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage
    other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the
    Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things
    depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino
    and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.
    .
    After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an
    amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has
    enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such
    as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots
    producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of
    same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.
    .
    Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and
    sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and
    down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or
    scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and
    vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player
    manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food,
    others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage
    of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't
    change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the
    form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted.
    .
    There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually
    the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards.
    The big events that happen randomly are:\n
    - M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing
    production for that round plus the money to replace it.\n
    - Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.\n
    - Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will
    skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other
    players).\n
    - Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the
    easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them
    waiting for better prices.\n
    - Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting
    food production and decreasing energy production.\n
    - Sunspot activity - increases energy production.\n
    - Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.\n
    - Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very
    rich crystite plot.
    .
    M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest
    played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in
    auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer.
    .
    M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for
    various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced.
    Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.

    The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when
    in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically
    pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the
    Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball.
    When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain
    possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an
    intended direction.
    .
    The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second
    and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals
    made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH
    shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing
    beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs
    out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time

    And, strangely enough, it feels almost like a clone of Bikkuriman World for the
    PC-Engine. Not really much else to say about it. Go play it now! Have fun. :-)

    Levels that take place entirely under water.

    Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a
    plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

    Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons.
    After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will
    appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can
    use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons
    ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons
    that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over
    time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy
    decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the
    standard weapon, he loses a life.

    Ta-Keed, the Prince of Darkness, has managed to escape from his supernatural
    penitentiary where he has had centuries to plot exactly how he will take revenge
    on those that locked him away. Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this
    threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the
    emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. These 4 adventurers must make
    their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.
    .
    The first part of Little Samson has each of the 4 characters journeying from his
    or her home land to the emperor's palace. This gives the player an opportunity
    to explore that character's unique abilities which will be essential throughout
    the game.
    .
    1. Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock
    climbing prowess. He is able to scale walls and hang across ceilings, and also
    grab onto walls and ceilings while jumping. His offensive option is the ability
    to shoot bells straight ahead.
    .
    2. Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice.
    When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts. She breathes fire in 2
    intensities, depending on how long the player holds down the fire button. Her
    fireballs spread in arc patterns.
    .
    3. Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong. So strong
    in fact that spikes do not hurt him, which is very valuable in a number of
    situations. He is also very slow and has only a short leap. He has a powerful
    punch.
    .
    4. K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other
    team members can not. He is also extremely fast and the highest jumper of the
    team. However, he is the weakest member so he can not sustain very much damage.
    He has the same wall and ceiling traversal abilities as Samson. Offensively, he
    can drop time-delay bombs.
    .
    When all 4 characters reach the emperor's palace, they all jump into Samson's
    bell. Actually, Gamm and K.O. quietly jump into Samson's bell; Kikira initially
    refuses. After a brief fight (with the player controlling Samson), Kikira joins
    the effort. Throughout the rest of the game, the player can switch between any
    of the 4 characters by entering the sub-screen. Each character has their own
    power meter. However, all the characters share lives. If the presently selected
    character loses all of his or her power, then one life is lost. The player must
    swap between all 4 characters in order to complete the journey.

    Fire Emblem is a strategy game where you have to move your units on a map. You

    you have to be one or two squares next to the enemy. When a battle is set, you
    see both characters; allies in blue on the right and the opponent in red on the
    left with a detailed animation. The enemy will counterattack if he can, and
    either you or the enemy may also do one more hit to close the battle. When
    you've finished, it's the computer's turn and it will do the same with its
    units. Once the HP (Health Points) of any unit reaches 0, they are definitely
    out of battle and can't return again, whether it's an enemy or an ally.

    Located on the northern shore of the Moonsea in Forgotten Realms, Phlan was once
    a flourishing trade city. However, lately monsters began settling in it,
    gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under
    human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the
    monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild
    Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in
    the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan
    and accepts the quest.
    .
    Pool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons
    role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the
    player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from
    scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four
    classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak
    the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.
    .
    Exploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a
    first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and
    take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party
    and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for
    defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts.
    Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while
    clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest.
    Non-human characters can also "multi-class" (learn the abilities of another
    class) when leveling up.
    .
    The NES version was substantially different from other versions. It removed
    references to the Adventure's Journal and some of the more complex features of
    the computer versions, like different currency units. Battles were significantly
    reduced in size, the graphics were overhauled and redesigned so that the game
    could be controlled with a control pad, and music was written for it. A randomly

  description:
    Kaijuu Monogatari ("Shell Creature Story") is an 8-bit RPG for the NES that more
    than superficially resembles Enix's Dragon Quest. As with many RPG
    contemporaries for the system, it borrows the basic premise (talk to the King,
    discover what to do next, fight some evil force) and the turn-based tactical
    combat and gradual character development of its major influence, but also much
    of its aesthetic: The box art has some Akira Toriyama-inspired artwork and the
    protagonist wears a familiar suit of blue armor. Kaijuu Monogatari's subtitle -
    Shell Saurs Story - is a localization of its Japanese name.\n
    The plot, in greater detail, concerns a race of peaceful shell creatures that
    have four elemental warriors that united to fight the villainous Fat Badger but
    were separated in the final struggle. The player needs to unite the four by
    exploring the world and discovering the locations of the other three warriors,
    then regrouping for another attack.\n
    A unique twist, though one that would also become a feature in Dragon Quest IV
    (thus coming full circle innovation-wise), is that the player is able to assume
    any of one these four heroes at any point by selecting a menu option, though
    each one begins at level 1 and is very weak. In order for the party to be strong
    enough to meet up, each must be independently raised to a sufficiently high
    level.\n
    The game would eventually spawn its own franchise with sequels and spin-offs
    being released for the Super Famicom and Game Boy in Japan.

    "Dungeon Magic" is a first-person RPG that looks similar to  Wizardry games, but
    instead of the usual turn-based combat you fight your enemies in real time,
    parrying to avoid their blows and attacking physically or casting offensive
    magic to hurt them. You explore large outdoor areas, towns, and dungeons, and
    specialize in five kinds of magic.

    This version removes most alternate solutions to puzzles and does not allow many
    actions that would render the game unwinnable. It also shortens and eliminates
    several scenes; for example, it is impossible to revisit the wizard in the first
    house. A few locations (such as the desert) are smaller. Some death sequences

    A curious addition to this version is that of the biorhythms, which tells the

    more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize
    around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical

    way the baby deals with the enemies is quite unusual: it inflates them. When
    inflated, the enemies lose control and begin to float, until they finally
    explode. The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they
    are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls,
    using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are
    necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter. There are various items

    The little kitten Kitty, her kitten friend Mimi and their bear friend Tippy love
    playing with balloons. One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons
    when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty
    and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her
    rescue.
    .
    Hello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid – a forced side-scrolling
    platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon
    in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by
    pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not
    pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound,
    but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B
    button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal
    platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden
    areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off
    the screen.
    .
    Throughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for
    points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double
    balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airbourne and ground-based
    varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water.
    Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight,
    these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.

    DAIVA Story 6: Imperial of Nirsartia is the sixth part of a seven part series
    developed by Toshiba EMI. The series is not a collection of sequential stories,
    but rather a presentation of the same story from seven different perspectives.
    Billed as an "Active Simulation War", each game has the player direct a
    different protagonist (or "hero") through a galactic war. In most versions, the
    player must travel from planet to planet, defeating enemy defense armadas, and
    then storming the planet in a mobile attack suit, destroying as much of the
    planet's defense systems as possible, all in an effort to take over the
    planet.\n
    When designing the Famicom version of the game, Toshiba EMI took the system's
    capabilities, as well as it younger market audience, in to account. The game has
    been considerably simplified compared to its computer counterparts. Before
    starting an action sequence, the player is allowed to place three power-ups
    along a map of the stage. When the player reaches these designated locations,
    the specified power-up will fall from the sky for the player to collect. The
    game concludes when the player locates and conquers two specific planets; the

    it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser
    cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the
    aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the
    end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot
    them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them
    lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the
    top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon
    are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will
    also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser
    canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.

  description:
    Bill and Ted are two surfer-speaking 1980s high school dudes from San Dimas,
    California.  After the events of the film Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,
    they seem free to build the band that will one day unite Earth's people and
    bring about world peace.  Except...  Rufus returns from the future with a
    warning that someone has warped the time continuum by kidnapping historical
    figures and stranding them in the wrong time period (...sooo, basically what
    Bill and Ted did in the first film?)  It's up to the boys to sort out the mess.
    .
    The player controls either Bill or Ted, who have split up to tackle the quest
    (allowing each to leave items to assist the other). Each "mission" begins by
    consulting a phone book of historical figures, and spotting the page whose
    number has changed (a second number, flashing in red).  The player dials that
    number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could
    only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to
    their destination, while avoiding any hazards. Each change in direction costs
    one coin.
    .
    Once in the target time period, the player controls Bill or Ted through an
    isometric view as they search for the displaced historical figure.  The player
    must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the
    locals.  Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if
    bumped into.  Other locals will actively chase Bill and Ted and throw them in
    jail, where they must use a skeleton key (if they have one) to escape. Players
    can find and collect coins for the phone booth, keys for the jail, and
    distractions (like pudding or tape players) to throw off any pursuers.
    .
    The player must also locate an item of "historical bait," appropriate to the
    target, to get them to follow. Once the historical dude has been baited and
    bagged, the player switches to the other member of the titular duo to rescue a
    new historical celebrity. The process repeats until time is corrected.

    Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big
    Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the
    game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab,
    nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big
    resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a
    number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each
    sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red
    dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E"
    indicates the exit.
    .
    Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies
    including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky
    Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can
    deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they
    will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with
    a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of
    ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at
    a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of
    your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like
    Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.
    .
    More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items
    that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if
    you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level,
    you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game,
    this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your
    local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?

    While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any
    window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window
    closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of

    6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands
    against the windows.
    .
    The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will
    encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he
    falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and
    will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger
    will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face
    the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable
    musical themes.
    .
    Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting
    carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every
    ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts
    reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can
    lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches

    One day, the peaceful nation of the Lextorians discovers the planet P'radikus,
    where numerous uncivilized tribes are constantly at war with one another. When
    they steal a spaceship and start to expand their wars across the solar systems,
    you are trained by the elders to halt their dominance and destroy the home
    planet with a secret weapon known as "Thunderbolt".
    .
    Using the typical thrust movement from the Asteroids games, you roam space with
    your starship to return the peace by force. Starting as a rookie, many enemy
    ships need to be destroyed to earn credits that can be exchanged for fuel,
    armor, weapons, shields and warp drives. The commander instructs you with
    specific missions, such as destroying outposts or freeing alien groups. However,
    your ultimate goal is to find the Toson Drive, the only device powerful enough
    to reach P'radikus. To spice things up, there are many weapons such as shock
    waves, mines, missiles, cloaking devices and atomic cannons. As your fuel
    constantly depletes, you often need to orbit new planets to refuel and stock
    weapons.

    The lovely princess Lala was kidnapped by the Evil Demons of the Empire. You are
    Lolo, a round ball-like creature (just like the princess herself), and your
    mission is to sneak into the empire castle and to liberate the princess.
    .
    Adventures of Lolo is a puzzle game, and each level is a castle room. The goal
    in each room is to collect all the hearts. It is not always easy, because some
    hearts are blocked by enemies who will shoot you when you cross their path
    horizontally or vertically (or both). Once you collect all the hearts, a
    treasure chest will open and activate all the creatures in the room, even those
    who were not hostile until now. You must quickly cross the room to the exit
    which is now available to go to the next room. The game contains 50 rooms in
    total.
    .
    The difficulty level increases with each room, and after a few levels there is
    an especially hard room with tougher enemies.

    girlfriend. Then, Jake has to save her and discover what lies behind that

    This game is a side-scrolling one, with the basic controls common to many of

    button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to
    still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use
    all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list,
    displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include
    healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter,
    wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy
    who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy,
    who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who
    releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping.
    You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.
    .
    Totally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant

    The game is set in medieval Japan, where a poor farming village is planning an
    insurrection to overthrow their feudal overlord. However, the only participants
    in the revolt are the player's character, Gonbe, and the optional second-player
    character, Tago (??), and the player battles against an army of ninjas instead
    of samurai and foot soldiers. The game displays text in the vertical direction,
    which was very unusual for a game of the period, and all in-game messages use
    speech reminiscent of jidaigeki films.\n
    The game consists of four different levels, with the fifth level being an
    alternate version of the first, the sixth being an alternate version of the
    second, and so on. The difficulty gradually increases as the game progresses,
    and the game levels loop infinitely. There is no ending screen for the game, and
    completion of level 99 brings the player to level 00, which is an alternate
    version of the fourth level. The player returns to level 01 after completing
    level 00. A "secret letter" appears on-screen after each of the first 8 levels
    in the Famicom version. The secret letters displayed are E, R, A, W, T, F, O, S,
    in order, and if the letters are read backwards as indicated in the game's
    instruction manual, they form the word "SOFTWARE." This code word was required
    for the gift campaign that was conducted during the game's initial release.

    Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation
    perverted into a world of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy).

    The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with
    nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you
    out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation
    is one of your main objectives).\n
    Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar
    (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on
    your way out).
    .
    Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person
    3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.
    .
    Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill
    system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.\n
    Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.

    In this second installment of "Greek mythology" RPG series, the main hero is not
    the legendary hero Herakles (Hercules), but a young boy from a town Nana, where
    he lives with his grandmother. The queen tells you that people are being
    tortured by Titans - an ancient god-like race controlled by the Lord of
    darkness. You must help to liberate people from the wrath of the Titans. Your
    first assignment is to go to Athens and to find the famous poet Homer who can
    tell you about the way to defeat the Titans. During your journey you meet many
    characters from the Greek mythology, including Daedalus, Cerberus, and
    Hephaestus, and recruit interesting creatures to fight at your side, such as the
    half-horse Centaur or the Woman Without Soul. You'll also encounter real people
    from the Greek history, like Homer the poet or Hippocrates the doctor.
    .
    The gameplay is similar to  Dragon Warrior style: you travel on the world map,
    visiting towns and dungeons, talking to people, and fighting random enemies and
    bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. An interesting
    innovation is a full day/night cycle. Locations look different at night, and it

    The California Raisins: The Grape Escape is a California Raisins video game
    developed by Radiance for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Capcom planned to
    publish the game in 1990 but its release was canceled due to the California
    Raisins' dwindling popularity because of the decline in raisin sales in the late
    1980s and early 1990s. In the single-player side-scrolling action game the
    player controls a California Raisin through five stages in an effort to rescue
    the band and their band's musical notes that were stolen by the gang of jealous
    musicians. The player walk, jump, climb on vines, moonwalk (by pressing the
    "select" button) and shoot an unlimited supply of grape jelly beans as
    projectiles. As was the case with other Capcom games, such as Mega Man and
    DuckTales, one can play the first four levels in any order that you want, but
    the final level is only available after you have collected the musical notes
    from each of the four levels. The first four levels include The Grape Vine, The
    Factory, The Maize Maze and The Juicery. The final level takes places in The
    Clouds. During each level you can collect 'I' icons that give you temporary
    invincibility, regular black musical notes for bonus points, 'Sunshine' icons to
    restore your health, and 'Raisinette' icons to give an extra life to the player.
    One can also locate items by shooting at the thin air or at columns.

    bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and
    water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms.

    color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect

    Stealth ATF is a flight simulator in which you pilot a F-117A, a.k.a. Nighthawk
    in several missions.
    .
    In every mission's beginning and ending you have to take off and land your plane
    respectively, from a side view. If you fail to land after completing the target
    objectives, you fail to succeed in mission and thus have to replay it.
    .
    Your view during the flight is from inside the cockpit, and the gameplay offers
    total freedom of movement on flight. Your terrain is infinite, and your enemies
    will re-appear in your radar every time they fly out of range. You fly in
    different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During
    flight, you can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.
    .
    Your mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. Your targets
    will always be aerial ones. You can shoot a cannon (which ammunition is
    unlimited) or missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots you a missile, you
    can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per
    mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once you pass out of the
    danger. If you manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is
    offered, and you have to try to take down as many enemies as you can.
    .
    The game can be played by one or two player taking turns. A second player can
    also take control of the aircraft closest to the center of the radar, either in
    one or two player mode.

    of Pocket Zaurus. Despite sharing the name with the product line, characters
    which resemble those used in the product are hardly ever seen, and the enemies
    are not at all related either. The idea for the game was submitted by a reader
    of the game magazine "Family computer Magazine," which was published by Tokuma

    seemingly random dots, then a pencil starts connecting the dots to form a
    picture. The first player to correctly identify the picture will earn a card for
    the color of the picture being drawn. As the picture draws, a dice on the screen
    will count down from 6 to 1. Whatever value is showing when a player
    successfully identifies the picture is the number of spaces that players game
    piece will move on the game board for the next turn. The color of the space the
    game piece lands on will dictate the category for the next picture to be drawn.
    .
    Each game will choose four categories from the various options, which include:
    tools, man made, clothing, food, math, office, travel, music, things, natural,
    leisure, and many others. After you've mastered the easier skill levels, the
    difficulty can be increased which will present more complicated pictures, remove

    The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by
    Billy & Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed
    her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a
    mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and
    final time.
    .
    The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved
    version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as
    well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the
    conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking
    system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.
    .
    The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as
    well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered
    2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.
    .
    The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a
    "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River
    City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

  description:
    The Rocketeer is based on the 1991 Disney movie of the same name. Nazis are
    trying to steal an experimental jet pack that will presumably give them a
    strategic edge in modern warfare for the purpose of world domination. It is up
    to the hero to don the jet pack and the helmet to stop the Nazis and keep the
    world safe.
    .
    The Rocketeer is a side-scrolling, run-and-jump (and sometimes fly) game. About
    halfway through the first stage, the Rocketeer is able to scavenge jet fuel
    power-ups, in addition to health and ammo power-ups. The fuel power-ups allow
    him to use his namesake power and fly for short distances. The Rocketeer has 6
    offensive options available from the start of the game, limited only by the
    amount of ammunition points he has in reserve: A punch (requires no ammo points
    and is therefore unlimited), pistol (1 ammo point per fire), tommygun (2 ammo
    points), spread gun (3 ammo points), grenade (5 ammo points), and a bazooka (20
    ammo points).

    gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to
    later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San
    Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.\n
    Once the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars or Tsuppari Suku
    mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a
    gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that
    belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a
    number describing the strength of the "neutral gangs." These "neutral gangs"
    will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue,
    or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in
    that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by
    saying "no" when asked to fight ("Struggle").

    Labyrinth is a maze game similar to Gauntlet, but with a more definite goal and
    some adventure elements. It is based upon the Jim Henson film of the same name
    incorporates many scenes from the movie as areas with the maze.
    .
    The goal of the game is to collect twelve coins Sara can use to buy back her
    baby brother from his kidnapper, the goblin king, Jareth. There is one coin in
    each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of
    the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of
    which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly
    goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick,
    for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it,
    and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected
    via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can
    open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she
    cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.
    .
    Throughout all this Sara is constant beset by enemies at which she must throw a
    neverending supply of stones to dissipate.  Her stones can be upgraded
    eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who
    will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.
    .
    All of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be
    restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds.
    However, there are several ways to gain more time, and part of winning the game
    is balancing actually solving the maze and spending time searching for minutes
    to do just that.

    The basic premise of the game is to get through the 72 rooms of the Fun House.
    The object of each room is to throw tomatoes at the targets littered throughout
    the room before time expires. Sometimes these targets are numbered, so they have
    to be hit in numerical order. After all targets are hit, a key will appear
    allowing the player to move on to the next room.
    .
    This may appear simple, but the player's character is on rollerblades, thus
    making navigating not such a simple task. There are also blobs, boingers, the
    banana launcher, and the spray gun which will either try to hinder progress or
    take away time if the player gets hit by them. The player also has to deal with
    various terrain obstacles in each room such as slime covered ramps or icy
    floors.

    The player starts with three lives, but can earn more by collecting 25 silver
    coins. There are also gold coins with each one equaling 5 silver coins.

    Other helpful items the player can collect are glop clocks, with the small ones
    adding 8 seconds, and the large ones adding 15 seconds to the game clock. There
    are also sneakers which will temporarily increase the player's speed. There are

    Players must play the role of a mother cat called Milky who lives in a dangerous
    metropolis full of dogs. The dogs want to kill Milky before she can rescue her
    son Michael who wandered out into the city on his own (and became lost). Players
    must catch the fish for temporary invincibility. However, the other enemies can
    still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad
    guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the
    pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for
    roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls. The fish merchants completely replace the
    dogs after the 30th level; causing the invincibility icon (fish) to become
    redundant.

    Unlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of video games (especially the
    first NES release which would come out four years later in 1989), open manholes
    kill the player instead of helping her evade the roaming dogs. Sewer snakes also
    come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can
    momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much
    younger audience than was considered to be "average" in the Nintendo
    Entertainment System community during that era. Using the classical music song
    Ballet des poussins dans leurs coques (composed by Modest Mussorgsky) as the
    background music, there is a common theme throughout the game of "dog catches
    cat; cat catches fish" - emulating the food chain.

  description:
    Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each
    level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit.
    To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy
    blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you
    will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way
    around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will
    cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by
    destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses
    and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks.
    Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal
    with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit
    in which it must be completed.

  developer: Atlus
  publisher: Atlus
  description:
    Despite what the name implies, Wacky Races for NES is not a racing game, and has
    nothing to do with the other games bearing the same name but the license. In
    this game, the player takes control of Muttley, the grumbling, but loyal dog
    from the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon. His master Dastardly sends his on three
    different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn
    is divided into smaller levels.
    .
    Muttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion,
    moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various
    creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is,
    unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to
    their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels,
    which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb,
    a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.

    player is equipped with a weapon that can be used to fire at the enemy monsters.
    The monster fighter can only walk in the four cardinal directions and thus only
    fire straight forward in whatever direction he is currently facing. The
    objective is to eliminate all the enemy monsters from the playfield to clear a
    level. Also, eliminating three monsters of the same type and color in a row,
    will cause a special monster to appear which can be shot for bonus points.
    Sometimes these special monsters will carry one letter of the word EXTRA.
    Collecting all five letters of that word will give the player an extra life.

    Igo Shinan ("Go Lessons") is a simulation of the popular board game Go from
    Hect. True to its name, it teaches players at both novice and expert level how
    to improve their Go game and provides some challenging computer opponents to
    play against. The player can set how much guidance the game will offer,
    including presenting possible moves for the player to take (generally, one is
    more favorable than the others) and allowing the computer to take over their
    turn. Hect would follow up Igo Shinan with four sequels, each referring to the
    year in which they were released: Igo Shinan '91, Igo Shinan '92, Igo Shinan
    '93, and Igo Shinan '94. Igo Shinan, and all its sequels, were only released in
    Japan. This was and continues to remain standard practice for most video games
    based on Go or Mahjong, as both board games are far less popular outside of
    Asia.

    Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous
    adventure games as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a
    multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based
    interactive fiction was the norm.
    .
    In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no
    memory of who you are or what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you
    soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him.
    Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing.
    From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever
    is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters
    worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.

    In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved

    Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai ("New Eight Dog Chronicles:
    Battle of Light and Darkness") is a traditional Japanese RPG that follows the
    story of the 19th century historical novel Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or Eight Dog
    Chronicles, based on eight half-brother samurai who were all descended from a
    dog and team up for various adventures across Sengoku period Japan. In
    particular, the game is based on the 1983 live-action movie, localized in the
    west as Legend of the Eight Samurai which in turn was based on a 1982 reworking
    of the epic novel named Shin Satomi Hakkenden.
    .
    The game has a then-distinct feature of being able to start the game as any of
    the eight samurai, each of which begins the game in a different location. Their
    goal is to meet up and recruit their brothers, eventually forming a group of
    eight. The game is otherwise standard for the genre: the player splits their
    time between exploring towns and talking to NPCs, and fighting monsters and
    enemy soldiers in dungeons and the overworld map via a turn-based combat system.

  description:
    This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character
    who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen
    only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your
    goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes
    easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you
    manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over
    to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your
    gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can
    deplete a large bulk of them.
    .
    The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you
    must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if
    you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything
    is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will
    slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously.
    Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to
    the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only
    way to successfully complete the game.

    In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role
    of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.
    .
    The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in
    a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the
    ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder,
    near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they
    splat on the ground instead.
    .
    The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.
    If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them
    jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus
    points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)
    .
    The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have
    reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float
    upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves
    are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons

  description:
    In Tiles Of Fate the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles
    within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching
    symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry.
    However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can
    not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your
    moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under
    a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash
    of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those
    surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls
    that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your
    next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included
    is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges!

    all you see is a usual neighborhood with houses, streets, etc. Random events
    will happen to your characters during their life. Most of those events will
    modify your character's parameters. For example, a school event will increase
    their knowledge, sports will raise their physical condition, etc. You'll earn or
    lose money depending on the event. Your characters will also meet up with each
    other, fall in love, and experience other events, good or bad.

    Players are assigned the role as the field commander of the blue colored forces
    who are in a battle against the red colored forces. Players take control of the
    Genesis, a flying saucer shaped craft, that can fire missiles, capture enemy
    units with a tractor beam, and deploy allied units onto the field.
    .
    The game's battlefield is viewed from a top down perspective. The Genesis has a
    target reticle that is always placed a certain distance in front of the craft.
    Players have to maneuver this cross-hair over any target they want to shoot or
    capture. The Genesis can also deploy up to six allied units at any one time to
    help out on the battlefield. Deployable units include soldiers, Hel-99A (tanks),
    FL-880 (mobile cannons), Kieths (mechanized infantry), and Louis (copters). The
    enemy's forces also consist of the same units, and both the Genesis and the
    enemy's Flying Crane craft can abduct enemy forces and add them to their side.
    .
    At the end of each battlefield is an exit that is defended by enemy turrets
    which most be destroyed in order to leave the battlefield. The game contains six
    distinct battlefields that loop back to the beginning when conquered, however
    the enemies will be more numerous and aggressive on the second time around.

    April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is
    kidnapped by the villainous Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and Rocksteady.
    The four ninja turtles: Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo fight
    their way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to rescue April. They battle
    familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag from
    Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final showdown with
    Shredder himself.
    .
    Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game is a port of the popular arcade
    game made by Konami during the height of the cartoon series' popularity.
    Depending on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take
    part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most
    of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with
    knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level,
    players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such
    as Bebop and Rocksteady).
    .
    The NES version of the game features additional content not present in other
    versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new
    bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly), additional music
    tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.

  game: Ms. Pac-man (Namco)
  file: Ms. Pac-Man (USA) (Namco).zip
  developer: Namco
  publisher: Namco
  description:
    In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form
    of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the
    dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to
    keep the title fresh.
    .
    Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging
    mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky,
    Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch
    from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.
    .
    Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four
    Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and
    Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600,
    progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as
    the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after
    Ms. Pac-Man again.
    .
    Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous
    intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms.
    Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".

  developer: ASCII Corporation
  publisher: ASCII Corporation
  description:
    Itadaki Street is a digital board game similar to Monopoly, from the creator of
    Dragon Quest, Yuji Horii. Much like its inspiration, players take turns moving
    around the board, which is divided into districts made up of multiple
    properties. Landing on a property allows you to buy it, and owning multiple
    properties in the same district increases their value, but landing on a property
    owned by another player forces you to pay them based on the property's value. A
    key element is the ability to invest in districts by purchasing stock, even if
    the player owns no property in that district, which increases the value of those
    properties and gives the player a cut of any transactions involving that
    district. There is also a roulette mini-game, and a chance board there players
    can pick random prizes. The goal is to be the first player to amass a certain
    amount of net worth, then return to the bank. Up to four players can play at
    once, with computer players filling in any empty slots. There are 7 different
    characters and five different board layouts to choose from.

  developer: BPS
  publisher: BPS
  description:
    Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is the first real attempt to bring the Japanese board
    game Go to a home console, namely the Famicom. The game was designed by Henk
    Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the
    time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the
    prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later
    converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987.
    .
    Prior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played
    on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics
    were more akin to "Connect Four" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is
    traditionally played on a 19 Ã— 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities
    would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size
    has been significantly reduced to a 9 Ã— 9 grid, which allows for a smoother
    single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas
    appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.

    "Sweet Home" follows the exploits of five members of\n
    an investigation group: Kazuo, Akiko, Taro, Asuka, and Emi. The famous painter
    Mamiya Ichirou lived many years in a secluded mansion, and rumor says there are
    some valuable frescos to find inside. Our investigators decide to take some
    pictures of the frescos. However, upon entering the mansion, a ghost-like figure
    of Mamiya appears  and threatens them. After this, they find themselves trapped
    in the mansion. The heroes must now find a way out of the mansion, not
    forgetting the frescos they came there for, and the destiny of an earlier
    investigation group that has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
    .
    "Sweet Home" is perhaps the first known example of survival horror genre,
    created by the same company that later made the famous  Resident Evil. However,
    "Sweet Home" is also a console-style RPG: characters fight random monsters in
    turn-based battles, equip various weapons and level up. You can (and must) form
    different teams from the five available characters, both for battles and for
    solving puzzles. Each character has his (or her) own item-based skill: Taro can
    take pictures, Emi can unlock almost any door, Kazuo has a lighter, Akiko uses a
    vacuum cleaner to remove dust and other obstacles, and Asuka has medical kits.

    Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest
    role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES
    console that started it all.
    .
    The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the
    earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally
    fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..."
    And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their
    first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real
    journey begins...
    .
    Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single
    character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six
    different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black
    Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to
    him. He also gives the characters names.
    .
    In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves,
    palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests,
    and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based
    combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments
    is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command
    (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the
    characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party
    members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are
    defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level
    and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party
    members can be revived in towns for a price.
    .
    Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two
    categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic,
    Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells
    in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by
    resting in inns.

    At the start of the game, one of three dragons can be selected (Bronze, Silver

    breath attacks. In each of the more than 12 missions, several objectives must be
    completed: enemy dragons must be hunted down, ships sunk and fortresses
    destroyed. The dragon can change between low and high altitudes to avoid
    obstacles and enemy fire and to attack certain types of enemies: ground troops
    can only be destroyed from the lower altitude, dragons only from the higher one.
    Killed enemy dragons leave power-ups that grant temporary protection, speed, or
    let the dragon regain health. Some of the missions include boss battles against
    large enemies like a giant kraken or a powerful dark wizard.

    It is a fairly basic platform game. You run and jump, and enemies are placed all
    around to try and stop you. The entire game, backgrounds, enemies and bosses, is
    food-themed. You encounter things such as sausages, microwave ovens, onions and
    hamburgers on your way through the restaurant. To your help you always have a
    frying pan to beat the enemies with, and you can also find other items, such as
    a spoon, and plates to throw at the enemies.
    .
    The game contains 6 stages, each in a separate location in the restaurant, such
    as the kitchen, freezer and basement. At the end of each level you are faced
    with a boss. In between each level is a bonus game where you play a slot machine
    to try and win some extra health and lives.

    WCW: World Championship Wrestling is an isometric  wrestling game of the
    National Wrestling Alliance.\n
    Players can choose to engage in one- or two-player matches as either 1vs1 solo
    bouts or 2vs2 tag-teams. Upon selecting a mode, players choose their characters
    from among twelve featured wrestlers from the NWA league. Licensed characters
    include: Rick Flair ("Nature Boy"), Sting, Lex Luger ("Total Package"), Mike
    Rotunda, Road Warrior Hawk, Road Warrior Animal, Steve Williams (""Dr. Death"),
    Kevin Sullivan ("Gamemaster"), Ricky Steamboat ("The Dragon"), Ric Steiner
    ("Dogface Gremlin"), Eddie Gilbert ("Hotstuff") and Michael P.S. Hayes. Each
    wrestler has unique abilities not shared by the other wrestlers, including
    finishing moves and rope toss.
    .
    Prior to a match, the player is presented with a menu of eight "moves", of which
    the player chooses four to assign to the points of the directional pad. Once the
    match starts, the player is only able to use the four moves selected and the
    rope toss to attack the opponent. Each wrestler can move up, down, left and
    right inside the wrestling ring, climb the turnstiles at each corner and throw
    opponents out of the ring (where they will be disqualified if outside for 20
    seconds). Each wrestler has a high damage "finisher move" which can only be
    performed when they are standing in the middle of the ring and the opponent's
    stamina bar is low.

    Chinese Hero is a top-down action game for one or two players, both playing on
    the same screen. Each ninja has the ability to move in any of four directions:
    up, down, left and right, as well as punch directly in front of them and do a
    "Moon Sault Kick" (which can be powered up to a "Miracle Kick") whereby they
    jump and somersault directly in front. Both punches and the Moon Sault Kick can
    harm enemies. Defeating a certain number of enemies on each level will open the
    doorway into the next level. Occasionally extra passages (named "Quick Passage
    Zone") can be found to take shortcuts through areas with stronger enemies. At
    times, defeated enemies will leave power-ups behind which either player can
    collect in order to increase their abilities temporarily. While power-ups are
    diverse, here are examples of some of the effects: weakening specific enemies,
    invincibility, increased attack, extra lives and the ability to use projectile

    kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations
    that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook.
    .
    If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear
    and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait
    Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own
    choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties
    that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To
    defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More
    often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of
    fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get
    other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters
    will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots,
    bombs, and fireballs.
    .
    In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and
    the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that
    gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes
    underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface
    again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to
    squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

    Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down,

    and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the
    same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects
    are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will
    clear all monsters of the diamond's color.\n
    There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up
    the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one
    object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a
    monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the
    stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling
    objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.
    .
    There are 5 different modes of play: a "Round Game" in which Toad has to clear
    numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player
    mode, a "Time Race" mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.

    perspective (none of the horses are "yours", and you don't get to place any bets
    or anything), you just change parameters and see what happens. The idea is that
    this game will teach you how to do well at betting on horse racing by letting

    important conditions that determine what makes a horse do well in a race. There
    are no ending credits or anything, there is no condition to "beat the game".

    There's a cross-country motorcycle rally going from San Fransisco to New York.
    In Rally Bike, the player has but one goal, to work their way up through the
    ranks of the racers and place high enough to qualify for the next race. The game
    contains six stages to race through.
    .
    The player controls a motorcycle and must cross the finish line before an
    established number of competitor bikes. The player must avoid crashing into
    obstacles, opposing racers, vehicles, and running out of gas. During a race
    there are certain areas where the player can refill their gas but stopping to
    refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage and race past the player.
    Competitors never run out of fuel but they are able to crash into obstacles thus
    taking them out of the race.
    .
    Occasionally during a race a helicopter will fly by dropping items that the
    player is able to pick up. The items are a 1000 Points Bonus, helper motorcycles
    that help you crash other racers, extra gasoline, Hi-grade gasoline which lasts
    longer than normal, a   turbocharger that gives extra speed, and a helmet which
    provides  invincibility.
    .
    If the player places in the top ten in a race, they are able to tune up their
    bike with better equipment. The player can upgrade their bike's engine (either 2
    cycle type or 4 cycle type) and its tires(either rain, brock, or stick).

  developer: Capcom
  publisher: Capcom
  description:
    Capcom's only 8-bit port of the Final Fight series, Mighty Final Fight follows
    the storyline and characters of the first Final Fight game. Mayor of Metro City
    Mike Haggar, his ninja friend Guy and his daughter's boyfriend, Cody learn that
    Haggar's daughter, Jessica,  has been kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang whose
    leader has fallen in love with her, and also wants the meddling Mike Haggar to
    leave town. Now it's personal! Choosing one of the three fighters, the player
    embarks on a beat-em-up quest through the streets of Metro City.
    .
    The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and a one-player only game (unlike
    other Final Fight ports). Also exclusive to this particular Final Fight game is
    the experience system which allows gaining levels to learn additional moves,
    similar to the first Double Dragon game. The characters have all been squished
    down to super-deformed 8-bit likenesses.  Graphically this looks similar to
    River City Ransom. Each character has a button for attack and a button for
    jumping. Pressing the two together unleashes a character-specific super-move.
    Various grabbing moves and throws can also be done by moving the player near an
    enemy.

  developer: Activision
  publisher: Activision
  description:
    Galaxy 5000 is an isometric-perspective space racing game where 4 spaceships
    compete head to head in outer space races. 1 or 2 human players can compete in
    the races; the rest of the ships are controlled by the computer. The ships
    complete several laps around each course and have limited firing capacity to
    throw their opponents off balance. The ships can also jump. In fact, the ships
    can jump right off the edge of the course and drop down (in space). If the
    player does not complete a course in good time, the entire race track will
    disintegrate and leave the ship to fall down (and apparently splash into some
    water below).
    .
    A notable item about this game is its use of squeaky, comical, digitized voices
    for exclamations when colliding with another player ("Hey!", "Excuse me!",
    "Watch it!"). There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a
    player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and
    drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed. The
    second scheme uses left and right to rotate the ship and up to thrust in the
    direction the nose is pointing.

    The year is 199x and a robot army has invaded Tokyo City. A boy and a girl (who
    remain unnamed) board their ships to fight off the threat.
    .
    This is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up game viewed from overhead, where the
    player pilots a fighter ship through seven levels of intense shooting action.
    Each level hurls enemies and bullets at the player's ship, ending with a boss
    fight, except for one which instead is a boss rush level. The game allows for
    two players to play at the same time.
    .
    The player has a choice of two weapons; bullets or lasers. Weapons can be
    changed by picking up gems of different colors. Picking up the same color as you
    already have allows you to upgrade your current weapon a few times. The player's
    ship can change form and with it the way that the weapons work. This allows the
    player to pick the best weapon strategy for each situation. The player also has
    a limited amount of bombs that are useful to get out of tricky situations.
    .
    When a weapon is upgraded it also acts as a shield so the ship can take an enemy
    bullet without dying. This will however degrade the weapon down to the first
    level again. There are also pickups that alter the ship's speed and a special
    gem that, if five of them are collected, temporarily transforms the ship into an
    invincible super ship.

    Crisis Force was only released in Japan.

    series. As with its immediate predecessor, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87, it is
    a slightly revamped version of the original with updated rosters. As with
    modern-day practice, Namco released these games annually with little to
    distinguish each new iteration. Unlike the previous versions there are now four
    stadiums to choose from. In addition to the size of the stadium, the presence of
    wind and the turf available in the stadium affect elements of the game. The
    concept of 'strong players' was also introduced in this version. Two players in
    the starting line-up are chosen at random to have their stats increased higher
    than usual. During the seventh inning, the 'Lucky 7' effect occurs, and all
    players receive enhanced status. The team edit function appears for the first
    time in this game (edited teams would disappear when the console power was
    turned off since no battery backup was included). Though this is the second
    sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, which was released in the US by Tengen as
    R.B.I. Baseball, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is not to be confused with R.B.I.
    Baseball 3. Though the first R.B.I. Baseball was a direct localization,

    screen allowing the player to start on any of the first 9 stages, make it so
    that certain colors of jewelry don't give you points, start a 2 player mode
    which has an optional time limit (the option is called "Flash" for unknown
    reasons,) and turn the music off. There are more music tracks than the original,
    and there is an indecipherable voice when you start a game. The title screen for
    this game is ripped from one of Columns' title screens. As well as this, some of
    the menu graphics are taken from Hatris and the ones in the 2 player mode bear a
    resemblance to those from Columns.

  developer: Hudson
  publisher: Hudson
  description:
    The game is based on famous Japanese folk tales. Momotarou is a boy who was
    found in a huge peach (hence his name, "peach guy"). When he grows up, he goes
    to the island of demons, fights them, takes their treasure, and restores peace
    in its village. In this game, you don't play directly the story of Momotarou,
    but control three other popular characters from Japanese folklore, playing three
    separate stories: as Yashahime, the daughter of the Hell King Emma; Binbougami,
    or "poverty god", who is hated by people because he takes money from them; and
    Urashima, the legendary fisherman who once saved a turtle and became friends
    with the dragon clan. Although the original stories have nothing or little to do
    with each other or the story of Momotarou, the game ties the stories together by
    featuring Momotarou as a character in every one of them.
    .
    Despite being primarily a game for kids (the story is told in a fairy-tale
    fashion), this is a full-fledged console-style RPG with levels, party
    management, world map traveling, dungeons, towns, weapons and armors, and
    turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies, viewed from first person
    perspective.

    This is a generic and very primitive mahjong game.  It  is Nintendo's second
    mahjong game made for the Famicom, the first titled simply Mahjong.  This game
    has smaller tiles than the first one but allows people to play against three
    computer opponents instead of one.  Both games made with a single 16kbyte PROM
    and 8kbyte CHROM, thus they don't use any special mapper chips.

    Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game
    played with the Chinese mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has
    little to do with real mahjong rules.
    .
    The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to
    be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded
    pattern, which is higher near the center. A tile can only be removed if it has
    no tile next to it on at least one side.
    .
    This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and
    features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten
    minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.

    getting on the road again.

  game: Cobra Triangle

  developer: Nintendo
  publisher: Nintendo
  description:
    Cobra Triangle is a single-player boat-racing game that lets you do more than
    race. It borrows the power-up system from the shoot 'em up genre but keeps the
    emphasis more on maneuvering than shooting. Since you have a health meter with a
    dozen bars in it, it's not that important to dodge bullets unless your health is
    really low, but you should try not to run into too many walls. In order to get
    very far you need to make use of your power-ups which are TURBO for better
    acceleration; FIRE for increased firepower; SPEED for increased top-speed;
    MISSILE for firing missiles as well as bullets; and FORCE which makes you fire
    tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You get
    roughly one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types
    of levels each with a different objective:
    .
    (1) Race to the Finish - Shoot other boats along the way to the finish line and
    avoid enemies like turrets and sharks. Some boats tow power-up pods behind them
    that you can collect after you shoot them. It doesn't matter when you finish,
    and you aren't told if you get 1st or 2nd or 3rd place... it seems that the
    other boats are only there to get in your way. Watch for the fork in the river;
    choosing alternate paths takes you to the same levels of the game but in a
    different order.
    .
    (2) Collect the Pods - Simply race in a straight path while running over ramps
    to collect pods and 1UP's in the air. You go on to the next level when time runs
    out.
    .
    (3) Dispose of Mines - There is a small square in the water with mines in it.
    You actually have to collect the mines and tow them to another square to make
    them explode. Of course, there is an invincible enemy boat that tries to steal
    them back from you and some guys that shoot at you. It takes awhile since you
    can only tow them one at a time.
    .
    (4) Fry the Monster - The 'boss' levels. You fight a sea-serpent, a crab, a
    shark, etc. He has his own health display right above yours, but it tends to
    deplete slower.\n
    (BONUS) Shoot the Targets - after every boss level you go to an auto-scrolling
    level where you are rewarded with a 1UP prize if you manage to shoot all the
    targets along the shore without missing any.
    .
    (5) Guard the People - There's a large square filled with 8 helpless swimmers,
    and for some reason they're all about to be kidnapped. Other boats race into the
    square and tow them away unless you destroy their ships before they get away.
    You can tow the people back into the square-if you have time-while avoiding the
    spaceships that fire stunning missiles at you. If you have at least one swimmer
    left when the timer runs out then you pass.
    .
    (6) Reach the Finish - Race in a straight course with plenty of obstacles but no
    other boats. You drive upstream while the current drags a horde of logs and
    whirlpools in your direction to stop you. Occasionally some planes fly by and
    shoot at you. If you happen to die in this or any other level, you simply
    reappear on the spot as long as you have an extra life. A continue puts you back
    at the beginning of the level you were on.
    .
    (7) Jump the Waterfall - A level that consists of a series of moving ramps you
    must use to jump over huge pits. Moving currents, whirlpools, and the violation
    of several laws of physics makes this more difficult than it sounds.
    .
    The entire game consists of repeating these types of levels for a grand total of
    25 stages. The later stages are much more difficult than the first. They're
    filled with additional obstacles like icebergs, more mines, more enemies, and
    longer courses. There are even speed-ramps that let you take small short-cuts in
    later racing levels.

    Top Gun is loosely based on the film of the same name. It is an action game in
    which the player controls an F-14 Tomcat fighter through four different
    missions.
    .
    The action is seen from a first-person cockpit view. Depending on the mission,
    different kinds of targets must be destroyed. There are always enemy aircraft,
    but some missions include sea and ground targets as well. Two weapons are
    available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can
    choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can
    only be carried in lower quantities.
    .
    Enemy aircraft either overshoot the players's plane from behind and can be
    easily taken down, or they come from the front and fire guns and missiles.
    Sometimes, an enemy plane will position itself on the player's six. It should be
    lost quickly by steering left and right, or instant death follows.
    .
    Halfway through missions two through four comes a refueling sequence where the
    fuel plane's nozzle must be aligned with one's aircraft.
    .
    Every mission (except the first one) features a final mission target, which can
    take a lot more damage than regular targets.
    .
    Each mission concludes with a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier. To
    successfully land, the player's plane must have a certain altitude and speed.
    Successfully landing gives bonus points, but crashing the plane doesn't end the
    game - it simply costs a life.

    falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs
    before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The
    three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white
    knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only

    This is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while
    avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other
    Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's
    also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also,
    there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your
    friend.
    .
    Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when
    you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top
    of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to
    turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and
    he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like
    the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the
    water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover
    beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities
    function just like boss weapons.
    .
    How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you
    gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time
    and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon
    with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to
    your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels,
    even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows:
    Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &
    Hard Man.

    Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also
    collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your
    health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for
    the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even
    Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. And, of course, you do get infinite
    continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.

  description:
    This game is a humorous "star simulation", or, better to say, a strategy game
    with elements of luck, in which your goal is to become a famous musician or a
    star of the Japanese theater, particularly succeeding in monomane, a technique
    of imitation. There are four characters in the game which are controlled by
    players or computer. The turns of the game are determined by a roll of dice. The
    characters are located on a city map, and move around it according to the number
    that their dice rolled, somewhat similarly to monopoly-type board games. Each
    time you stop, you access a location where various things happen: you can select
    theater pieces and perform on stage, try to impress people, etc. Sometimes you
    land on a location that leads to a mini-game (swimming, playing ball, and
    others). Winning such a game gives an additional boost to your career.

    through six different selectable levels that take place in different Konami
    games and save that game's star character with a key who the player can then
    play as. Each character has different abilities to begin with as well as ones
    they can eventually gain. The player ventures through these first six levels in
    a sort on non-linear fashion with gameplay.

  description:
    Popeye no Eigo Asobi (Popeye's English Game) is the Japanese-exclusive spin-off
    to the Popeye arcade game.\n
    The game includes three modes: Word Puzzle A, Word Puzzle B, and Word
    Catcher.[3] In Word Puzzle A (based on the first level of the original game),
    the player is given the Japanese term for a word in one of six categories:
    Animal, Country, Food, Sports, Science, and Others (due to technical
    limitations, these terms are displayed entirely as katakana, regardless of their
    origin).[3] Blank squares for the English word are given, and the player must
    maneuver Popeye around to point to letters of the alphabet in order to fill in
    the blanks. Each wrong letter entry prompts Brutus/Bluto to punch a basket
    carrying Swee'Pea; the player must solve the puzzle before Swee'Pea's basket is
    knocked off the platform it is attached to.\n
    The player may also forfeit the puzzle by punching the "?" icon. If the puzzle
    is lost or forfeited, the correct English word will be displayed. Word Puzzle B
    is identical to the "A" mode; however, the player is not given the Japanese term
    beforehand. In the two-player Word Catcher mode (based on the third level of the
    original game), the first player controls Popeye and the second controls Bluto.
    Three Japanese words are displayed on the screen's left side, and both players
    compete to collect letters thrown by Olive Oyl to spell out their English
    equivalents. A player wins when he or she has correctly spelled five words.

    .
    While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with
    five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick
    each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as
    possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on
    the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal,
    each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts
    from the judges, and win the competition.
    .
    While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on
    a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's
    stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping
    abilities?

    A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink. The gameplay
    involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on
    spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in
    turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in
    an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but
    taking one two spaces away.
    .
    When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into
    that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with
    any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is

    Attack Animal School is more than a little inspired by Sega's popular Space

    replaced with a uniform-clad schoolgirl, who must shoot down enemies which come
    flying, jumping or crawling towards her. The enemies are no longer spaceships,
    asteroids or dragons. Instead, they are various cute and furry animals, such as
    kangaroos, cacti with sweatbands, turtles and flies. The end-of-level dragons
    are also decidedly cuter, with the first level boss being a fluffy koala. Attack
    Animal Gakuen is one of few Famicom games to support the 3D glasses (like Space
    Harrier 3D for the Master System), though it is perfectly playable without

  description:
    Like the original Pac-Man, the basic game play of Pac-Man Championship Edition
    consists entirely of navigating Pac-Man through a maze, eating dots, power
    pellets and bonus items (such as fruits, keys, and other objects), and avoiding
    the four ghosts that roam the maze as well. If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, the
    player loses a life. Eating a power pellet causes the ghosts to turn blue,
    allowing Pac-Man to eat them and send them back to their home, where they
    re-emerge in their original form.
    .
    However, there are several major differences from its original counterpart,
    making Pac-Man C.E. a faster paced game. Each maze is divided into two halves.
    Eating all the dots on one half causes a bonus item to appear on the other side,
    and eating the item causes a new maze to appear on the other half. Players can
    also collect additional power pellets to increase their powered up time and
    continue earning maximum points for eating ghosts. The longer the player stays
    alive, the faster the game gets and the more points can be earned. As opposed to
    levels, the game is played within a certain time limit, with players attempting
    to get the highest score possible.

    Zoids: Mokushiroku, or Zoids: Apocalypse, is a strategy game based on Tomy's
    Zoids franchise. It plays like an ordinary strategy game, but when two units
    face each other, it becomes more action oriented. The player can choose between
    a turn-based strategy game or a real-time strategy game, something that makes
    this game unique among other strategy games. Earthquakes occasionally happen,
    which can change the environment by blocking paths, creating new ones, etc.

  game: Die Hard
  file: Die Hard (USA).zip
  developer: Activision
  publisher: Activision
  description:
    John McClain decides to visit his wife Holly in Nakatomi Plaza, only to discover
    that she is taken hostage on 30th floor, along with a bunch of other hostages.
    The main terrorist, Hans, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th
    floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. It's up to
    McClain to stop them. Die Hard for the Nintendo Entertainment System is a lot
    different to its other counterparts. The game is played from a top-down
    perspective, rather than the 1st-/3rd-person perspective.
    .
    There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and the task is to
    clear each floor of terrorists. The stairwell, air duct or the express elevator
    is used to travel only to Floors 31-35. These are freely accessible at any time,
    doing away with linearity, and more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). At
    the start of the game, John can only use his fists to deal with foes, but after
    bringing down some terrorists, several weapons become available, including the
    pistol, machine gun, C-4 explosives, rocket launcher, and flash bangs, using
    their weapons against them. When hit by these terrorists, John loses some life,
    but it can be restored by collecting soda cans and med-kits. The game ends when
    all life is lost.
    .
    One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting
    orders to his guards through a two-way radio. Also notable is the "foot meter".
    It starts out full, but will eventually decrease if John steps on shattered
    glass or runs around at a faster speed. If the meter is empty, he will walk much
    slower than with a full meter. This may have been added in tune with the film,
    where the main character John McClain's feet end up in pretty bad shape near the
    end. Parts of the environments are destructible, most notably vending machines
    (receive free soda), glass walls and windows. Not all parts of the environment
    are shown on the screen all the time - a fog of war appears to shroud nearby
    areas in darkness.
    .
    The missions are time limited. There about four minutes before one of the six
    locks are opened (shown in the status screen), but more time can be gained by
    destroying the main computer on the fourth level. Once all the locks have been
    opened, there are only a few minutes to escape. Once this time expires, the game
    ends.
    .
    Like its counterparts, the game features cinematic sequences, which change the
    story depending on which actions are taken.

    ground and be stunned by a moment.

    Ki will also find chests with items to help her (like warps to higher levels of

    side of the Siege of Osaka. Yukimura was called "A Hero who may appear once in a

    heroes who took an active role at the battles of Osaka Castle. They were called
    the Sanada Ten Braves, the group of ninjas who are also referenced by the

    The third game in the series is basically the same as the second. The story and
    the stages are different, of course, but it doesn't really matter. Choose your
    favourite turtle and kill as many Foot Clan soldiers as you can, fight the
    bosses and reach Shredder in a Double Dragon-styled game.
    .
    The graphics and gameplay were improved. And, if the choice of the turtle
    depended only on personal taste in the second game (as they were all the same,
    in different colors), in this third episode they gained individual special
    moves.

    but soon escalates into a wider plot that pits the rescue rangers against their
    arch-nemesis, the feline kingpin, Fat Cat.

  developer: Sunsoft
  publisher: Sunsoft
  description:
    In Nantettatte!! Baseball you control one of 16 cartoon-styled teams and try to
    lead them on to victory. The gameplay is simple and similar to many other
    baseball games released on the NES, with five ways to play. You can play a
    versus mode against either the computer or a partner, take a team through a
    season of between 30 and 130 games in hopes of winning the pennant, play a
    multiplayer tournament, or play a home run derby and try to knock as many balls
    as you can out of the park. There's also an edit mode where you can configure
    your team for the Pennant Mode, and a "Watch" mode where you can watch a
    CPU-controlled match.
    .
    Each of the sixteen teams, just like actual baseball teams, have strengths and
    weaknesses. Seven of the teams also have designated hitters, who replace
    pitchers when it's their turn at bat. All teams also have eight starters, who
    can be switched out at any point (but cannot be switched back). The teams can
    play in either one of four stadiums, which all are basically the same.

    Pyramid is an action puzzle game similar to Tetris. Stones of various shapes and

    stones so they fill complete lines at the bottom of the screen. Should the
    stones reach the top of the screen the game is over. If you get in trouble,
    there are a limited number of bombs that can be used to clear a small section of
    stones at the bottom hopefully giving you more room to work with. Unlike the
    square and rectangular shaped pieces found in Tetris, each of the shapes in
    Pyramid have one or more angles to them making complete lines more difficult to

    show note location, a 5-channel Backing track, 4 timbre choices, and controllers
    to manipulate common synthesizer parameters such as release and attack, LFO,
    etc. It also provides recording and play back function.
    .
    The player has many choices of styles of the backing track, from popular styles
    such as Rock, Techno, and Jazz, to various ethnic flavors such as Bossa, Rio,
    Japan, India, Arabia, etc.
    .
    The backing tracks representing the styles use familiar elements to make the
    game more accessible to the general audience. For example, in the Scotland style
    Cadence to Arms, a familiar bagpipes tune, is used.
    .
    Most backing tracks loop around one or two chords, allowing an open
    improvisation on the main keyboard. Once the style is chosen, the main keyboard
    is masked in the way that only the scale that easily fits into the style is
    available, e.g. blues scale, pentatonic scale, etc.
    .
    The keyboard is controlled by the UP-DOWN or LEFT-RIGHT d-pads on the game
    controller so there is no way to play leaps in the scale.
    .
    Due to the hardware limitation, the sound produced is the typical 8-bit chiptune
    music.

    Featuring Japanese celebrity "Tokoro-san" as its protagonist, this is a

    traverse Tokyo, armed only with a water pistol. Cute nasties which look like
    fantasy creatures run at him and must be shot down. Others come out of holes in
    the ground beneath collapsing platforms, and certain monsters will, when shot,
    run away from Tokoro-san and run down all monsters in their path. Shooting the
    pistol will use up the water reserve, which will decrease the range of the
    shots. Leaving enemies alone when possible is therefor a good strategy. When
    Tokoro-san enters a house, a boss battle must be run through before he can
    choose a path to other districts in the town. When the player is hit too many
    times by monsters, or the water pistol runs out of water, the game is over.

    Join one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history for Roger Clemens'
    MVP Baseball. While the game does not come with the license of Major League
    Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling
    those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player
    names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player
    represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M.
    Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C.
    Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox.

    The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games.
    Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and
    Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield
    stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most
    baseball games as well.

    A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be
    exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season

  description:
    Super Real Baseball '88 is a baseball game developed by Pax Softonica for the
    Famicom and published in Japan by Vap in 1988. After Namco excited the market
    for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other
    companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.
    .
    This title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining
    permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the
    official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a
    groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an
    existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened
    shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren
    Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants
    at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.
    .
    To further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic
    approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more
    cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball
    games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter
    hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field.
    Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very
    difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching,
    and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.

    land and then choosing the proper golf club, stance, and grip. The last step
    before taking the swing is finding the correct contact point on the golf ball.
    The contact point is represented as a dot that scatters around on top of a golf

    In this game you are Rad Gravity, a futuristic heroic spaceman.  A mad scientist
    disrupts the peaceful universe and it is your job to visit various planets to
    re-establish contact between all the worlds. Sights vary between verdant
    planets, lava pits and hazardous jumps, with gravity variations and craters.
    .
    The game is a platformer and on each world you must fight your way past many
    enemies. You can collect different weapons and additional health bars which will
    help you when you face the evil boss. With the main computer you can choose your
    next destination - but many puzzles rely on the usage of items found on a
    different world; e.g. an alien-translator.

    The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends
    more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy
    items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However,
    instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must
    attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump
    higher.

    scrolling space shooter that owes its name to the space fighter from  Star Wars
    movies. You have a wide variety of weapons at your disposal: Fire, Cannons,
    Jump, Hammer, etc. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages. For
    example, Cannon fires powerful and rapid blasts, but you can only shoot directly
    in front of you; Van covers several directions, but has slow speed; Anti builds
    a protective shield around you each time you shoot, but its range is very small,
    and so on. You can change the weapons every time you are killed, before you run
    out of lives and lose the game. Typically, at the end of a level you'll have to
    face a boss enemy.

    In English, it is sometimes referred to by its long form, Jumpin' Jack, or by
    its subtitle, Tobidase Daisakusen Part II. The game was only released in Japan.
    The sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner),
    JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view,
    where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character. As in the
    previous title, the main character Jack must travel through various worlds,
    armed with his laser cannon and jumping ability, to defeat the serpentbeasts who
    have overrun the planets. JJ was the last game by Square to utilize the "3D
    mode" and 3D glasses, and was Square's last work before the inception of the
    popular Final Fantasy franchise. The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks,
    and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D
    WorldRunner. The game was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, and is Uematsu's 16th work of

    Again it's up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and

    of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a
    Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the

    room(s). All the rooms are connected but not all the room entrances or exits are
    closed.

    To fight the monsters Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be
    obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.

    There are numerous types of obstacles in the rooms. Emerald Framers are green
    blocks that Lolo may push around freely. To make it all more challenging there
    are also numerous terrain obstacles, like water, sand and grass which have all
    different drawbacks for Lolo.

    Higemaru Makaijima (Makaijima Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken, lit. Hell Island:
    Great Adventure of 7 Islands) is an action-adventure game developed for the
    Famicom and MSX home computer, and released by Capcom in 1987. It is a sequel to
    a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither
    the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan,
    although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it
    was to be renamed "Makai Island".\n
    In Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must
    now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His
    goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys
    which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate
    ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate
    ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small
    modifications.\n
    Once Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around
    the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to.
    Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items,
    defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another
    island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon
    exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared
    to.

    take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

    The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a
    side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally
    and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow
    up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a
    trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so
    the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.
    .
    The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels
    in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods,
    changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in
    control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room
    to search.
    .
    After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount
    of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before
    they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you
    have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass
    for guidance.

    5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.

    direct recreation of the film.
    .
    You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is
    slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your
    rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals,
    although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means
    that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another.
    Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.
    .
    From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so,
    you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you
    loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

    and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to

    the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers,

    A couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in
    addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a
    large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game
    never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the
    information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map
    using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing
    this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the "Turbo File,"
    which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware

    Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling.
    These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching
    safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops,
    gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

    You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can
    be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions
    which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing.
    You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to
    activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different
    amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.

  description:
    Tetris 2 + BomBliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle
    game. There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular
    Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included
    is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.
    .
    Tetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard
    endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is
    B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is
    C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of
    garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.
    .
    BomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is
    filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike
    Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed
    line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of
    blocks.
    .
    BomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the
    player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top
    three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with
    clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is
    Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.

  description:
    In the future city of Monsteropolis, the use of robot labour has helped
    civilization grow more than ever before. At the forefront of this technology is
    Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots
    to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman,
    Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions.
    Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots
    and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with
    the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who
    had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega
    Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and
    end this madness.
    .
    Mega Man is a side-scrolling platformer. Mega Man has the ability to jump and
    fire his weapon. He must travel to the levels of the six robot masters and
    defeat them in combat. By doing so, Mega Man is able to acquire their power for
    his own. These powers can then be used interchangeably with his main weapon and
    target the weaknesses of specific enemy bosses. Additionally, some hidden areas
    of the levels can only be accessed by using certain captured robot weapons. A
    special  Magnet Beam ability can also be found which can be used to create
    steps.
    .
    Travelling throughout these levels, Mega Man is confronted by an army of lesser
    robot creations. Destroying these usually yields energy capsules (for refilling
    Mega Man's Energy), weapon capsules (for refilling Mega Man's special robot
    weapons), and extra lives shaped like Mega Man's head.

  description:
    The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the
    screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which
    are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade,
    before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
    .
    The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy
    bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing
    to safety.
    .
    By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and
    Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as
    they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the
    wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the
    ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able
    to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that
    slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired
    tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

    interesting mix of heroic fantasy and classical chess - the player must use his
    pieces, a move at the time, to capture the opponent's king while protecting his
    own. However, Castle Quest features a lot more pieces than traditional chess
    such as Wizards, Ninjas, Orcs, Mummies and even Dragons.
    .
    Each piece comes with a set of attributes such as Health, Magic, Defense and
    Attack and these lie at the center of the gameplay - unlike chess, when one
    piece attempts to take another they have to fight to determine who takes the
    square. Each fight is round based and driven by the roll of a dice (symbolized
    by playing cards going from 1 to 10). Some pieces can also use magic spells or
    special attacks - some pieces use healing powers whereas others throw fireballs
    or even resurrect lost pieces.

    Pescatore was briefly revealed to the public in spring of 1991 at Nintendo's

    Li Jing had a son named Ne Zha. The boy had extraordinary talents for martial

    day he went to swim in the sea and disturbed the prince of dragons. The prince
    became angry and went out of the water to fight Ne Zha. Unaware of the power of
    the artifacts, Ne Zha unintentionally killed the prince. The Dragon Lord could
    not China if Ne Zha stays alive. Ne Zha killed himself to protect his land, and
    Tai Yi, touched by his sacrifice, revived him and made him more powerful than
    ever before. Now Ne Zha is strong enough to find three other legendary warriors
    and to defeat the evil king Zhou, the last one of Shang-Yin dynasty, and to put
    a just ruler on the throne instead.

    near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone
    missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr.
    Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help
    from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and
    rescuing Sandy.
    .
    Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion,
    and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are
    carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object
    (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may
    have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the
    puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used.
    If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the
    dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their
    freedom.

  game: Nobunaga's Ambition II

  developer: Koei
  publisher: Koei
  description:
    Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th
    century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended
    with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will
    become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally
    subject to the Emperor.
    .
    The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide
    the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The
    objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through
    death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through
    natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first
    job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through
    agricultural development and town investment.
    .
    There are two scenarios available in the game:
    .
    1. Warlords: 1560 A.D.\n
    The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a
    full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here.
    There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the
    Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.
    .
    Nobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.\n
    The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and
    allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies
    or rivals.
    .
    Samurai\n
    The game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in
    the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a
    conquered fief.
    .
    Each samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War,
    Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes
    for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these
    attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill),
    rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level).
    .
    Strategy\n
    The game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events
    take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September),
    while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player's time table.
    .
    The game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in
    a particular month. Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of "Body Points" that
    represent the attention he can afford to spend on an action. Each action has a
    cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he does not have the
    point’s necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little
    each month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level
    of his Political skill. Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then
    require turns of inaction to stock up again, so timing actions to coincide with
    Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of resources.
    .
    Combat\n
    Each samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained,
    and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a
    tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area
    of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and
    actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the
    defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a
    withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions
    as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size.
    .
    Unit Types\n
    The game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry (Inf), Cavalry (Cav),
    and Rifles (Rif). Each unit type has certain special abilities and tactical
    advantages/disadvantages in combat:
    .
    1. Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map (explained
    later) and have 4 movement points;\n
    Cavalry have the ability to charge at an enemy (inflicting considerable damage
    on both sides) with the chance of breaking through the defending unit and
    emerging on the other side. Samurai leaders may often be killed (instead of
    captured) if their unit reaches zero. Cavalry have 6 movement points; Rifles may
    attack using muskets which have devastating offensive capabilities, which may
    also kill an enemy samurai unit if the opponent's unit reaches zero (thus, a
    standard non-rifle attack is also available for capturing an enemy samurai
    leader). Rifles have 3 movement points.
    .
    .
    Additionally, both Infantry and Rifle units may move over walls or through water
    during the castle siege for a certain amount of movement points.
    .
    Tactical Combat\n
    Tactical combat occurs in two different locations:
    .
    The first is the tactical map of the fief, where the attackers first arrive and
    the defenders surrounding the castle. In this setting, each days is divided into
    three time periods: morning, afternoon, and night, before the day ends. At
    night, armies may maneuver to surprise attack enemies in the dark, which does
    considerably more damage than an average attack. This may be done if the enemy
    is at least two squares away (not adjacent).
    .
    The second is the castle siege map, which occurs if the defender chooses to
    retreat to the castle from the previous map. Here, each turn represents one day,
    thus the time limit of the attack as well as the provisions of both sides,
    rapidly decrease with each turn. In this setting, the siege force must break
    down gates leading towards the castle for the final engagement. The defender is
    defeated, if the governor of the fief retreats, or if his unit is destroyed:
    resulting either in his capture or death.
    .
    The end outcome is either the fall of the fief to the attacking forces or
    victory for the defenders. Either way, captured samurai (if any) will require a
    prompt response for release, beheading, or recruitment to the winner's force.

  description:
    The drama surrounding Tetris is one of the most storied sagas in the history of
    the NES. Tengen, an ambitious Atari-associated game developer, began releasing
    official NES games in 1988. Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the
    scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial
    cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first
    unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just
    the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the
    Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the
    world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's
    tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that
    Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately,
    almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to
    Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely
    lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your
    collection, but it's a worthwhile play. After all, Tetris is one of the classic
    games not only on the NES, but of all-time.

    Aeons ago, two dragons and their follower were fighting each other. The  "Black
    Mages" worshipped the three-headed Chrome Dragon, and the "White Mages"
    worshipped the glimmering Gold Dragon. The wars fought for territory and ideals
    where endless. After ages of fighting, the god Narume put the Chrome Dragon to
    sleep in the mountains and the Gold Dragon to sleep in the desert, to stop the
    wars. Then he took th magic away from the mages, and sealed it in the 8 Magic
    Books, which he hid in the sacred desert tower.
    .
    Hundreds of years later, three thieves stumbled upon the desert tower, and found
    the Magic Books. They split them up amongst themselves and every one of them,
    walked his own way. Now that the Magic Books were gone, the Chrome Dragon awoke
    from his slumber.  Narume then infused the Gold Dragon with the spirit of
    justice, summoning him forth in the form of a hero named "Feram"\n
    Now it is up to him, to find the Magic Books and put the Chrome Dragon to sleep

    more favorable than the others) and allowing the computer to take over their
    turn. Hect would follow up Igo Shinan with four sequels, each referring to the
    year in which they were released: Igo Shinan '91, Igo Shinan '92, Igo Shinan
    '93, and Igo Shinan '94. Igo Shinan, and all its sequels, were only released in
    Japan. This was and continues to remain standard practice for most video games

    .
    The first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can
    go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords
    (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held
    by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the
    way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly
    everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:
    .
    Ray Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power;\n
    Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping;\n
    Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and\n
    Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.
    .
    It is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage,
    because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the
    party members has died.

    Transforming into a dragon is restricted by a power meter.

    game, as well as the best-known (but not the only) version on Nintendo's first
    home console. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a
    ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear. As rows
    are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack
    reaches the top of the well.
    .
    The game offers two different modes of play, "Type A" and "Type B". "Type A" is
    a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines,
    with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. "Type B", on the
    other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and
    starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute
    animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.

    Released in the arcades in 1983, Donkey Kong 3 is the third of the "Donkey Kong"
    arcade game series, changing the format to more of an action-shooter than a
    platform game.
    .
    As Stanley the Bugman, players are positioned under Donkey Kong, who has taken
    over a multi-level greenhouse.  Stanley's goal is to remove Donkey Kong from the
    greenhouse, but the big ape isn't willing to leave without a fight.
    .
    Donkey Kong will agitate two beehives that are close to him to send down a swarm
    of angry Buzzbees, Beespies and destructive Queen Bees toward Stanley.  These
    insects, as well as caterpillars which creep down nearby vines are intent on
    destroying the flowers below Stanley.  Donkey Kong will also send down
    projectiles himself in an attempt to stop Stanley's attacks.  Stanley must jump
    between the levels and use his bugspray to repel the insects, and send Donkey
    Kong into the next area of the greenhouse.
    .
    Once Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough, a can of super bugspray will become
    available, allowing a larger shooting radius, and is able to send Donkey Kong up
    the vines faster.
    .
    Once Donkey Kong is sent through the three levels of the greenhouse, Donkey Kong
    will end up with a beehive on his head, and the levels start all over again.

    challenge anytime soon, every gang in the city sends its team hoping to come up
    on top.
    .
    Crash 'N the Boys: Street Challenge features the same basic gameplay engine and
    mechanics found in the rest of the Kunio/Nekketsu High games. The player
    controls a character in side-scrolling levels and try to defeat opponents using
    an arsenal of attacks and special moves. Unique to this game is that in order to
    clear the five stages, the player must also accomplish a series of sport-themed
    objectives. There is a throwing event, a golfing event, swimming, jumping, and
    all-out fighting events, all with unique twists inspired by the street/gangs
    theme of the game (e.g. the jumping event involves jumping across the rooftops
    in the city).
    .
    Depending on the player's performance in each event they may earn medals that
    can be exchanged for power-ups and stat increases. The game supports two players
    co-op or vs. gameplay.

    Like Konami's other adaptation of Batman Returns, the NES version is a
    side-scrolling beat 'em up. Next to brawling action, it also features two
    sections where the player controls the Batmobile and the Batskiboat seen in the
    movie.
    .
    In the beat 'em up sections, Batman has to defeat a large number of enemies
    (members of the Penguin's circus gang) to advance. Possible attacks include
    punches, sliding attacks, drop kicks and a powerful 360° cape slash attack which
    will drain Batman's health bar. Gadgets to be used include a limited number of
    batarangs and a grappling hook. The hook is useful for many things: it can take
    down flying enemies, pull Batman up to higher levels, lets him climb into open
    windows and more. Hidden in background items somewhere in the levels are
    power-ups, including hearts that refill the health bar and extra batarangs.
    .
    Each of the six levels in the game concludes with a boss fight against one or
    more especially powerful enemies.
    .
    The Batmobile is armed with machine guns and bat discs, used to dispatch the
    enemy bikes and cars in the driving level. The Batskiboat section is similar,
    except that there are no enemies and the only goal is to collect coins for extra
    points.

    the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards
    for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.
    .
    Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to
    Frostbite Falls.  Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer
    variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving
    characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch
    instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle can
    throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.

    You start in December of 1465 and the game then ends by the end of 1492. The
    time ticks off, based on the number of steps you take, what means that you'll
    want to keep your steps as low as possible.\n

    Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!? ("Drop Down Puzzle Tonjan?!", sometimes known as
    simply Tonjan) is a puzzle game from NMK that features anthropomorphic pigs
    pushing mahjong tiles around in a maze, attempting to push entire stacks down
    one of the many holes in the area. Bonus points are awarded for pushing certain
    specified tiles into holes first, and there's one tile in particular that will
    complete the level once pushed down a hole and is the only compulsory target.
    Future levels increase the number of tiles and the difficulty, adding fish tiles
    that cause the player to lose a life if they are pushed down a hole.\n
    Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!? appears to a sequel to NMK's earlier Arcade
    multiplayer action game Butasan, which features similar looking pigs. The rights

    Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Issh 80 Nichi Dai Boken (lit. "Puss in Boots: An
    Adventure Around the World in 80 Days") is a video game based on the third film
    of The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots that was released exclusively in Japan
    for the Family Computer. Four years later, the game (with several modifications)
    was released in North America under the title Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great
    Adventure.\n
    Pero has to either avoid or eliminate this cat-like enemies who stands in his
    way. The main character is the Puss in Boots character from the tale; a cat
    named Pero (Toei Animation's mascot) He is also known as 'Perrault' in the game,
    as that was the name of the original author of the Puss In Boots story; Charles
    Perrault. He is known for helping an impoverished master attain wealth through
    the use of trickery.\n
    Loosely based on Jules Verne's classic novel Around the World in Eighty Days
    tied together with a classic anime, the player has 80 days in order to travel
    the world; this is shown through a time limit. One day passes in the game
    approximately every minute, although certain items can subtract the number of
    remaining days, providing the player with less time to complete the game. If
    these 80 days elapse before the player finishes the trip, the game is over no
    matter how many lives the player has remaining. Places that are explored
    include: England, the Atlantic Ocean, Arabia, Hong Kong, the Pacific Ocean,
    Alaska, the North Pole, and Big Ben. The game features "death water," a video
    game feature where video game characters instantly die after coming into contact
    with a watery substance.\n

  description:
    LJN's NES version of the classic horror series casts the player as a teen
    searching the houses on Elm Street for Freddy Krueger's bones. Once they are all
    collected, they must be thrown into the high school  furnace to destroy Freddy
    once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream
    Warriors).
    .
    Nightmare has two worlds. In the red-tinted "real world," players fight snakes
    and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have
    a "sleep meter" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter
    drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted "dream world," where
    enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also
    starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief
    boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world,
    and deducts a life from the player if drained.
    .
    Players can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become
    "Dream Warriors" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give
    a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level
    takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster
    with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down
    Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.
    .
    Nightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four
    players to play at once using the same screen.

    Controlling ZED from an overhead view, the player is able to move in any of 4
    directions (up,down,left,right), drop bombs and shoot a projectile weapon. The
    terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy

    different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including

    The primary gameplay mode is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shooter similar to

    enemies, and your secondary missile weapon is used to attack fixed placement,
    land-based enemies.  Numerous powerups are available along the way, and these

    band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.
    .
    Legacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its
    predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which

    occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit
    the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second
    game.

    Character classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very
    similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment,
    however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible
    to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the
    party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral

    The game itself plays from a top-down perspective, a bit like The Legend of
    Zelda, but with some extra RPG elements added in. It features a basic leveling
    system that maxes out at 10 and basic HP and MP stats that increase by 10 each
    level up until they reach 99. The stages are also in the same vein as The Legend
    of Zelda in regards to the dungeons, albeit in a much simpler form. Instead of
    an overworld, you instead pick from five stages on a world map and each stage
    follows the same basic formula that consists of finding the key to open the door
    to the boss. Each stage contains various enemies that respawn, the occasional
    warp point, and a handful of chests that contain a new weapon, accessory and
    healing items. The final stage also follows the same pattern, but it's about
    five stages combined into one and borders on torture/redundancy with a series of
    mazes and long passageways that take forever to pass. It is at odds with the
    first five stages.\n
    The game makes use of a branching path system that's based on the order in which
    you clear all the stages. If certain events are not triggered, you will get a
    bad ending. The optimal order is as follows:Castle, Ice Temple, Cave, Pyramid,
    Tower. If you enter the Tower before the Cave level, you will\n

    popular Sanrio characters including Hello Kitty, Keroppi and Minna no Tabo.
    Matches can be played in with either two, three or four players. Players can
    choose between three different tracks of background music, or to simply play
    without the music.
    .
    The game is basically a volleyball/tennis game but without the nets, closely
    resembling four-square. There is an option to increase the difficulty level that
    modifies the level of intelligence with which computer-controlled play. There
    are opportunities to commit do-overs. After the end of the game, the player is
    awarded with a large ostrich trophy.
    .
    Though the game was released exclusively in Japan, a fan translation to English
    was made.

    In Amagon, your mission is to investigate a dangerous, monster-infested island.
    As Amagon, you begin the game with only a machine gun and a limited amount of
    ammo to protect yourself from the inhabitants of the island. Gameplay is an
    arcade style platform game with six levels, each with a variety of creatures and
    a large boss at the end. When you destroy an enemy, a power up will sometimes be
    left behind. Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more
    ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then
    have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in
    size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the
    transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you,
    points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back
    into your normal size.

    mode, either character may be selected, but the CPU will not compete at any game
    other than rock-paper-scissors. Players begin with a limited number of lives
    which may be lost by colliding with enemies or performing poorly at minigames;
    one extra life is also awarded at the end of each island. However, there is also

    Kyatto Ninden Teyandee is a side-scrolling action game in the tradition of Ninja
    Gaiden, and it is based off the Japanese TV show produced in 1990 by Tatsunoko

    Sukashii, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies.
    .
    By pausing the game, you can switch out and change places with one of the four

    All seven playable characters have an upgradable special move, which can be used
    by pressing Up + B. Each move is more devastating than the last, but can only be
    used a certain amount of times, until the Ninpo bar is drained.

    The game is a fairly typical one-on-one fighting game. It appears to use a
    similar engine to Rex Soft's fighting games, with slow walking, quick jumping,
    and generally choppy animation. The A button punches and the B button kicks,
    with both having different animations if the player holds Back or Forward while
    attacking. It is possible to throw by pressing Back and A while close, and
    blocking is performed by holding Back.\n
    The cast consists of 10 original characters. Each character has two duplicates
    with different names and colors. In single-player, the player always uses the
    original, and the computer always uses the first duplicate.\n
    Much like the first Fighting Hero, the game has a high difficulty level that
    cannot be changed, although the player is given nine continues.

    The player has a choice of two weapons; bullets or lasers. Weapons can be
    changed by picking up gems of different colors. Picking up the same color as you
    already have allows you to upgrade your current weapon a few times. The player's
    ship can change form and with it the way that the weapons work. This allows the
    player to pick the best weapon strategy for each situation. The player also has
    a limited amount of bombs that are useful to get out of tricky situations.

  description:
    In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy
    named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom
    and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.
    .
    The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the
    popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various
    forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret
    entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken
    Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death
    Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.
    .
    The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the
    Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into
    several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a
    screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If
    link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but
    when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range.
    .
    Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three
    hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that
    increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close,
    some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart
    to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff
    in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down
    to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead
    and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again.
    .
    There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while
    others are used to solve puzzles.
    .
    To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an
    entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies
    and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be
    able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in
    the Overworld come back to life.
    .
    If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start
    position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When
    Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which
    is essentially a harder version of the game.
    .
    The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the
    time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would
    permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save
    feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start
    over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery,
    secrets, and exploration.

    Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where
    players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds
    against different boxers to win the championship title belt.
    .
    Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the
    shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming
    punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross,
    but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.
    .
    By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available,
    inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of
    three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over
    (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a
    single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch
    buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an
    energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and
    during intermissions, some energy is restored.
    .
    All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A
    password system is used to save the progress.

    Wars were included like Czarist Russia, Great Britain, and the Spanish Empire.

    "Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 2" is a board game, during which you follow the lives
    of up to 4 characters. The game is best played as multiplayer, but you can also
    allow the computer to play for other characters, or create all of them on your
    own. In the game, you are presented with a board which is composed of tiles. A
    roll of dice determines the amount of steps a character will take on the board.
    Depending on the tile he steps on, different events will occur. If the tile is
    empty, a random event will happen. Other tiles are connected to a certain aspect
    of a person's life. For example, "learning" tiles will trigger an event that
    will make the character more intelligent (like studying for the school), and a
    tile with a "love" icon will lead to a romantic encounter and raise the love
    level of the character.

    10-Yard Fight is a simple arcade game based on American football. One player can
    play against the computer or a second player head-to-head matchup and can choose
    between five levels of difficulty (high school, college, pro, playoffs, and
    Super Bowl). If you win a game at a lower difficulty level, the following game
    is automatically played at the next highest difficulty level.
    .
    Gameplay is top-down and vertical-scrolling. There are no plays or formations to
    select from before the action begins; the player can take the snap as
    quarterback or choose one of two players on defense. On offense, the player can
    either keep the ball on the run, toss it to one of the two running backs, or
    throw long to the receiver; an interception turns the ball over to the other
    team. If a touchdown can't be scored, then the directional kicking system can be
    used to punt the ball or try for a field goal. One game consists (accelerated
    real-time) 30-minute halves of play to decide who wins this 10-Yard Fight.

    The series stars Wagan, a mysterious creature resembling a green mechanical
    dinosaur who must protect his homeland of Wagan Land from the mad scientist Dr.
    Devil. The games features standard side-scrolling stages where the player must
    reach the goal, as well as boss encounter where the player must compete in a

    The objective of the game is to reach the end of each action scene by making the
    best use of Wagan's sound wave attacks and jumping ability. The player must
    confront a boss at the end of certain stages, but instead of actually fighting
    the boss in battle, the player is challenged to a mini-game where they must
    score more points than their opponent. The graphics in this installment featured
    simple backgrounds with bright colors. The boss theme that was later used in
    Wagan Land 2 and Super Wagan Land was first used in this installment for the
    shiritori and concentration mini-games.

    (Blue vs. Red) fight it out across 16 imaginary scenarios with armies modeled on
    NATO and Warsaw Pact forces of the late 1980s.
    .
    The game alternates between two modes of play: a strategic/operational scale, in
    which players move their units around the hex map; and a tactical combat module
    for resolving unit-to-unit combats.  In the tactical mode, human players have
    the choice of either issuing orders themselves or using the "auto" mode which
    delegates command to the AI.\n
    Splash graphics and text messages convey battle results.
    .
    By capturing towns and winning battles, the player gains "fame" points that can
    be used to purchase more and better military hardware.  Every scenario ends only
    when the same, single victory condition is achieved by one of the two sides:
    destroy the opposing side's main battle tank unit in combat.
    .
    Winning any one of the first 15 scenarios yields a letter of the alphabet;
    together, the letters spell out the password that must be entered in order to

  developer: American Game Cartridges
  publisher: American Game Cartridges
  description:
    Death Race is seemingly inspired by the Sylvester Stallone movie Death Race 2000
    released 15 years before this game. The object of the game is to run down
    innocent pedestrians in your souped-up automotive grim reaper. Progress through
    the race courses in 8 U.S. cities, moving from west to east starting with San
    Diego and Phoenix. Each race consists of capturing a flag and finding the exit
    door, all while squishing or gunning down as many people on foot as possible
    while avoiding helicopters and heat seeking missiles that are actively trying to
    discourage this unique hobby. If the time runs out, a barrage of missiles
    descends on the player's car to indicate that the race is over.
    .
    The player has a certain amount of money to begin with and earns more money for
    completing the races alive. This money can be used to upgrade the engine,
    steering, tires, chassis, or weapon systems on the car.

  description:
    Meimon! Takonishi Ouendan (usually localized as "The West Tako Cheerleaders",
    but literally translates to "Prestigious School! West Tako Cheerleading Squad")
    is a Famicom strategy game based on the manga of the same name about a young man
    who joins his school's intimidating cheerleading squad. In 1987, this same
    property also saw a live-action movie adaptation.
    .
    The game has players moving characters around a city map and fighting rival
    ouendan teams for dominance. Combat occurs whenever two units meet on the map
    and cuts to a timing-based mini-game where the player has to input a command
    before their opponent's fist reaches the current character's profile. The closer
    the fist gets, the more likely it is that the enemy gets in their attack before
    the player can. Stronger attacks are listed further down the menu, increasing
    the risk vs. reward factor as the player scrambles to execute them in time.
    .
    After winning a map, the player's party can gain levels and acquire new special
    attacks, which show up in the attack menu on rare occasions and are very
    powerful.

    RPG Jinsei Game  is a Japan-only role playing game for the Family Computer that
    is similar to Jinsei Game, which is the Japanese version of The Game of Life.
    .
    The object is to explore a city full of stores, places of employment, and
    learning places. Starting from home, the player must earn money and statistics
    in order to unlock the better features of the game.
    .
    Unlike most games based on the Jinsei Game series, RPG Jinsei Game doesn't use a
    spinner system. Instead, the controller pad is used for movement and random
    encounters are featured like in Dragon Quest. The player can also talk to
    strangers who might either give him/her advice or do something malevolent to
    him/her. As in the actual Game of Life board game, the player has to choose from
    a series of careers ranging from a musician to a photographer and even a
    professional wrestler. Most of these tasks are mundane while one of the quests
    directly involves chasing down unidentified flying objects. Buildings that are
    crucial to the quest (other than shops and learning places) can be fully
    explored; otherwise the player simply talks to the resident.

    Fights can occur like in a real role-playing game. However, the players stats
    are used instead of hit points and magic points

    The plot is based on a TV sitcom of the 60's named Gilligan's Island.  Your ship
    crashed on a deserted island, and now you must get back to civilization.  The
    stranded people on the island are: Gilligan and the Skipper ( the crew of the
    ship), a millionaire and his wife, a professor, and Mariann who is a homely
    Midwest U.S.A. girl.
    .
    Despite the name, you'll be playing as the Skipper. Gilligan follows you around
    as a comedic relief sidekick. The game is divided into four episodes; the goal
    is always to locate all crew members in a limited amount of time. To do so the
    two heroes have to navigate the maze-like island and collect items - every found
    character provides hints for the next step.
    .
    There are also a lot of dangers which have to be faced: wild animals and
    headhunters can be fought with your bare hands and fallen rocks or obstacles on
    the ground have to be avoided. A common nuisance are holes in the ground which
    lead to the underground caves: Gilligan is likely to fall into these. If this
    happens Skipper has two minutes to get Gilligan back. There are three items
    which help Skipper on his quest: bananas replenish his health, hourglasses give
    extra time and the rope is used to get Gilligan back instantly.

    The game is based on the popular Japanese manga series "Dragon Ball" - more
    precisely, its Saiyajin Saga part. It follows the events that occur after the
    evil Radditz tells Son Goku, the series' main hero, about his true origin as a
    Saiyajin, and suggests uniting their powers. As Son Goku refuses, a battle takes
    place, and the defeated Radditz threatens to harm Son Goku's son, Son Gohan.
    Many friends come to help Son Goku, and even his rival Piccolo joins forces with
    him. But the quest leads them much further - to the ultimate battle against the
    leader of Saiyajin...
    .
    In this fighting/RPG game, you control multiple characters from the series: Son
    Goku, Piccolo, Krillin, Yamcha, Tienshinhan, Chao-Zu, and Son Gohan. You have to
    train each character by taking him to battles. All the movements in the game, in
    battle as well as on the field, occur by collecting and choosing cards of
    various strength. You move around by selecting a card, and can advance a certain
    amount of fields depending on its value. You train characters in special
    training stations before taking them to fights. Once you have trained your
    character and chose the cards, the battles flow automatically, as cinematic
    sequences that show Son Goku and his foes exchanging blows while flying.

    Musashi no Ken - Tadaima Shugyou Chuu (lit. "Sword of Musashi - Now in the
    Middle of Training") is based on a Japanese sports manga series written and
    illustrated by Motoka Murakami that focuses on kendo, simply titled Musashi no
    Ken. The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's
    other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode.\n
    The game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He
    strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers
    around the world of Kendo and its up-and-coming competitors. The anime is broken
    up into two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school
    while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode,
    Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series.\n
    There are two different modes: single player and two player VS. mode. On single
    player mode, the player depicts Musashi in the middle of his training. He must
    run through several obstacle courses collecting swords and other items along the
    way. At the same time, his pet Akita will be running the course behind him.
    Musashi must not fall too far behind his dog. After completing three courses,
    Musashi will be entered into a 2D weapon-based versus fighting-style Kendo
    tournament. He must defeat five competitors to win the tournament. The swords
    that Musashi collects during the obstacle courses provide him with access to
    special strike moves if he has collected enough. If the player succeeds in
    winning, the game will continue from the beginning at a higher level of
    difficulty. After winning the championship a second time, the game is over.\n
    On two player vs. mode, each player selects from a roster of competitors, and
    selects them secretly by pressing different inputs on the control pad. The
    selections are revealed once five selections have been made. Each player then
    squares off in a Kendo match with each of their selections. Whoever gets three
    or more victories wins the game.

    slowing the truck down. The draw bridge course features drawbridges that go up
    and down. If the bridge is down, the truck can pass, if it is up, the player has
    to wait until it comes back down to continue. Donut features races around a
    small donut-shaped track against an opponent. The combo course event involves

    is a turn-based strategy with quite modern armies, the abstract "Blue" and "Red"
    countries (controlled by the player or AI), are at war with each other. Three
    basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Like in other
    Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several
    types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Attack is possible, when enemies are near.
    .
    .
    The game includes 30 maps with varied types of locations and terrains (islands,
    deserts, mountains, etc.) Each terrain type has different movement and defence
    values. This version uses "fake hexagons" for battlefields; the hexagons are in
    fact squares, with six neighbours. As opposed to most other versions, it has
    round-based combat, i.e. a turn ends when the player has moved all the units. It
    also has a less complex management system than the computer versions.

    Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting

    reason, you should not let enemies pass unscathed, since they may shoot back at
    you from off-screen. At some points, power up capsules will materialize in
    space. They will grant you not only greater firepower, but also serve as a
    reconfigurable armor, which is SDF's main selling point. The armor may be moved
    from your front to your back, and while it is moved in a large arc, it will
    destroy any enemies it happens to ram. When fastened to your rear, it will also
    grant a small speed boost. Learning to use the armor is the key to surviving in

    including Straight Pool and Nine Ball, a trainer mode, and several table colors
    to choose from. There are also several different frictions (or lack of) that you
    can add to the table, including ice and sand. This option gives the balls a
    slightly different behavior, increasing the challenge.

    Magic Carpet 1001 (called "Arabian Nights" in Chinese) is an unlicensed

    Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1
    multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.\n
    The game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes
    place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are
    many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides
    a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow
    set patterns that become more complex with each level.\n
    As well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a
    flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often
    being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at
    random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P
    power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an
    icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several
    hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your
    character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one
    hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time.\n
    Oddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the
    levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the
    boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in
    distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the
    names that appear in other Mega Soft games.\n
    This game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical
    apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as
    decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts.
    It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.

    An alien menace has attacked the worlds of civilization and laid waste to their
    planets. However before the being conquered, a group of scientists has managed
    to create one last weapon and hidden it underground. The name of the weapon is
    Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however
    is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across
    the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.
    .
    Mag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a
    tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component
    pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive
    power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark
    craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary
    slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy
    fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on
    the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss

    The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

    Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too
    sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you
    seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of\n
    isometric death await.
    .
    The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by
    encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard.
    To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As
    frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances
    annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what
    challenge lies in the next room.
    .
    The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items;
    you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises
    with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through
    a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The
    dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade
    items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a
    special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he
    executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the
    left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save
    option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you
    like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.

    Rocman X (also known as Thunder Blast Man) is an unlicensed game created by
    Sachen, released on the Famicom and NES sometime in the 90's and also sometime
    later for the Game Boy Color. The NES and English Game Boy Color versions were
    released as Thunder Blast Man, the Chinese version of the GBC game released as
    Rockman X Gold, and one of the NES versions' label calls it Thunder Blaster
    Man.\n
    Rocman X's title screen is mostly copied from the first Famicom game of
    Rocman's, with the logo taken from Rocman X. The game also includes a story in
    English where Gadem City celebrates its centennial before the mayor's daughter,
    Miss Lucy, is kidnapped by the Paulung-Tang gang, who then take over and
    sabotage the city, holding it for a $20 billion ransom. Thunder Blast Man
    himself (also commonly known as Rocman X) appears to be based on Rocman/Mega Man
    and bears a passing resemblance to Quickman from Mega Man 2, as well as sporting
    a cape.  His default weapon is a boomerang as opposed to a standard Mega Buster,
    and only one can be thrown on screen at a time. You can get different weapons as
    well as buy a spare continue (if you don't have one) by visiting stores located
    before boss fights in each world, save for the motorcycle stage. As well as
    this, Thunder Blast Man has a charge move triggered by holding B and, after it
    fully charges (designated by the health bar flashing) releasing it while holding
    up, left, or right to fly in that direction (releasing it while being still
    cancels the move.)  This allows him to get across many pits throughout the
    game.\n
    The first three areas are available on the stage select screen, and most stages
    (save for the fourth area, where the boss is fought at the end of a single
    motorbike area) are split into two parts and a boss each.  After clearing these,
    the game becomes linear as you access the last three areas automatically in
    order.  The fourth area is a motorbike chase scene which looks and plays
    somewhat similarly to the speedboat sequence towards the end of Wave Man's stage
    in Mega Man 5. If you die in a stage you can continue from the point that you
    left off at (assuming you have a continue; you always start a new game with a
    continue) but if you used it up or don't have one you have to restart at the
    stage you're currently on, losing your bought weapons in the process.  This is a
    bit different in the mine cart segment of the final world, as falling into the
    spikes give you a game over regardless of health or continues, but you restart
    the level with your on-hand items (spare continue and/or weapons) intact.  The
    ending explains that Thunder Blast Man has saved Gadem City from the
    Paulung-Tang gang and that the city has made a statue of him.

    and a cap. That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess
    Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing
    axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.
    .
    The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to
    right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which
    results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses
    his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game
    mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily
    decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by
    collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way
    to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.

    Long ago, when magic still prevailed, the evil wizard Mangar the Dark threatened
    a small but harmonious country town called Skara Brae. Evil creatures oozed into
    Skara Brae and joined his shadow domain. Mangar froze the surrounding lands with
    a spell of Eternal Winter, totally isolating Skara Brae from any possible help.
    Then, one night the town militiamen all disappeared. The future of Skara Brae
    hung in the balance. And who was left to resist? Only a handful of unproven
    young Warriors, junior Magic Users, a couple of Bards barely old enough to
    drink, and some out of work Rogues. You are there. You are the leader of this
    ragtag group of freedom fighters. Luckily you have a Bard with you to sing your
    glories, if you survive. For this is the stuff of legends. And so the story

    Mappy the mouse had a son named Happy. Happy has grown up and now wants to
    settle down with a wife. However, the girl he wants to marry won't agree to
    marriage until Happy can prove that he can provide for a family. So now it's up
    to Happy to collect a small fortune so he can please his would be spouse. Of
    course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making
    this an easy endeavor.
    .
    The game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by
    kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can
    spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is
    useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure
    boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items
    for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he
    loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect
    some of the lost money.
    .
    After each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First,
    Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic
    items. Now, to actually win these  prizes, Happy must go up against one of the
    Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by
    losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving
    flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a  minigame where Happy stands
    back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform.  The
    other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the
    opponent can.
    .
    After the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items
    for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is
    worth marrying.
    .
    The two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his
    brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove
    their worth as a suitable husband.

    The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally.  Player
    graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number
    of players to nine per team.  Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns
    and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.
    .
    There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes.
    The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either
    hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the
    top to the bottom of the screen.  Defense consists of trying to guess which
    offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the
    defensive players before the snap.  A very simple power meter system is used for
    kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.
    .
    There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but
    there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you
    left off.

    series and Asian franchise. The game was released around the same time the anime
    was aired. It was the fifth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling
    approximately 1,500,000 copies in its lifetime.\n
    The plot begins when a young ninja name Kanzo Hattori was in search of his
    master in order to complete his training. While searching for his master, he
    encountered a young 10-year-old boy name Ken (Ken'ichi) Mitsobahis and made him
    his temporary replacement master, in order to develop Ken's confidence, while
    they went on many adventures together. It was aimed at a young audience the same
    way as the manga and anime it is based on.\n
    In the game, player controls Kanzo Hattori in a side-scrolling action game.
    Hattori must run to the right over various terrains, but primarily through the
    woods. In addition to using throwing stars, Hattori can access one of the other
    ninja techniques, like Kagebashin, Happou no Shuriken, etc. In fact, he learns a
    total of 11 ninpou; however, he must first collect scrolls that provide those
    abilities before he can use them. Due to sluggish controls, it can be difficult
    to clear some of the obstacles that he will face without the ninja abilities to

  developer: LJN
  publisher: LJN
  description:
    Based on the board game, the object is to guess either a word or phrase based on
    a drawing. Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team
    attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the
    clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the
    team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and
    guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on
    the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.
    .
    This game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and
    drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made
    comprising of any number of players per each team.
    .
    In the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of
    one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size
    and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of
    four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the
    player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint
    Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue.
    In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the
    more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If
    the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse
    Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many
    boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right
    side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your
    boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box
    brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy
    Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue
    spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any
    enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of
    the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the
    ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people
    above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing
    while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.
    .
    The alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to
    guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same
    as the regular mode.
    .
    Drawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the
    pressure of a timer.

    "Erika & Satoru" plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, although you can
    also move on the overworld, visiting locations by standing on them and pressing
    the A button. Upon visiting a location, you can interact with characters and
    objects you view from first-person perspective by selecting icons located in the
    corner of the screen: talk to characters, examine, manipulate items, etc. The
    unusual part is that you control two characters: you can (and should) switch
    between them and sometimes work together in order to fulfil your quest. There is
    also a two-players mode, where Erika and Satoru cooperate while being controlled
    each one by a different player.

    Street Fighter. The controls are similar to the original Street Fighter in that
    A punches and B kicks. However, the controls are often criticized because
    attacks initiate once the player lets go of the button. You're also unable to
    walk while holding a button. If you let go of the button too quick, Leon will
    only move for about a frame and the attack won't come out. Jump attacks preform
    a bit differently: you must hold the button and then jump. Leon will preform the
    attack a certain point in the air. For whatever reason, you're unable to preform
    special moves unless you have a cheat code.

    Castle Quest is a strategy game loosely based on chess by Hudson Soft. It is an
    interesting mix of heroic fantasy and classical chess - the player must use his
    pieces, a move at the time, to capture the opponent's king while protecting his
    own. However, Castle Quest features a lot more pieces than traditional chess
    such as Wizards, Ninjas, Orcs, Mummies and even Dragons.
    .
    Each piece comes with a set of attributes such as Health, Magic, Defense and
    Attack and these lie at the center of the gameplay - unlike chess, when one
    piece attempts to take another they have to fight to determine who takes the
    square. Each fight is round based and driven by the roll of a dice (symbolized
    by playing cards going from 1 to 10). Some pieces can also use magic spells or
    special attacks - some pieces use healing powers whereas others throw fireballs
    or even resurrect lost pieces.

    Dance Aerobics is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics
    instructor.
    .
    Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4
    by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the
    player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on
    screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake
    counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of
    repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time
    however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less
    practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each
    level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the
    successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they
    can enter later to skip that level.
    .
    The second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat
    Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been
    where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is
    like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise
    to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80
    points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a
    one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet
    where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every
    successful position.
    .
    The third mode is Aerobics Studios.  Aerobics Studios is the same as the main
    game but with only 4 levels (Studio 5,  Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) all
    unlocked at the start, a score that counts down from 100 with mistakes (or up if
    the player is doing well), no progression in levels, and the player can continue
    playing even if there score is at 0.

  description:
    In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the
    nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would
    often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming
    the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious
    Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the
    role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.
    .
    Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in
    different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three
    Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a
    larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is
    rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and
    IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game.
    The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes
    increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.
    .
    During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands
    from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying
    Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe
    & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the
    defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each
    player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move,
    bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them
    into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of
    enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

    game mode and shoot "rats" that pop out of holes on the game board. It is just
    like any typical shooter game that utilizes the NES Zapper; if you have played
    Duck Hunt, you already know what to expect here. This game is a bit more
    fast-paced though, which certainly adds to the difficulty level in later levels.
    It may be worth checking out if you are a fan of light gun games.

  description:
    Elysion, though a fairly traditional 8-bit JRPG in many respects (the first
    thing the player does is talk to the local King for exposition, for example),
    draws its influences from a lot of very different games within the RPG family:
    It superficially resembles the first Dragon Quest, it allows the player to
    select between multiple protagonists when starting the game as is the case in
    Final Fantasy, the combat system is real-time combat without screen transitions
    such as something like Hydlide or Ys and the enemies have an odd habit of only
    moving when the player does, such is the case in many strategic Roguelike
    dungeon crawlers like the Mystery Dungeon series.
    .
    The goal of the game is to defeat the evil demon Baal. However, the King first
    tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle
    and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large
    dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat
    Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls
    and, eventually, special God-like equipment.
    .
    "Elysion" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for
    honorable souls that died in battle.

    Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player must work through six levels by completing
    certain objectives including rescuing the kids Tim and Lex, restoring power,
    destroying Raptor nests and finally getting off the dinosaur-infested island. To
    advance in a level, a number of dinosaur eggs scattered over the area must be
    collected or destroyed. This will reveal a passcard used to gain entry to
    buildings, or some other items necessary to complete the assignment. The park's
    computer terminals can be used to request hints on where to go next.

    Naturally, the levels are full of hostile dinosaurs. Dr. Grant can fend them off
    with his gun. Several ammunition types are available, varying in damage and
    shooting patterns. Killed dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo type,
    the others must be found. Next to ammo clips, there are boxes with question
    marks on them to be collected. These might include beneficial powerups like a

    San Guo Zhi: Qun Xiong Zheng Ba (The Romance of Three Kingdoms: The Fight Of
    Heroes' Pleiades) is a fighting game in the setting of the Chinese era of Three
    Kingdoms made by ASDER at an unknown date. This, most likely, has nothing to do
    with Koei's Three Kingdoms-based 3D fighting game, Dynasty Warriors.
    .
    This game doesn't use a 'traditional' Street Fighter II engine, instead, it
    comes up with a heavily modified engine from Samurai Shodown. Several features
    that weren't present in any other fighting games on Famicom were included: a
    'rage' gauge that may be refilled by holding BW+A and performing a super move
    when it's fully charged; three-tiered health bar; and, finally, the 'conquest'
    mode, where you have to eliminate all of your opponent's fortresses in order to
    win.
    .
    The game has six playable characters, with every of them selectable from the
    beginning (from left to right): Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Huang Zhong, Cao Ren, Mei Ya
    [?] and Lu Bu. However, during the 'conquest' mode, there are two more
    characters that are not playable the regular way: Shi Ren and Xie Seng. Both of
    them are slightly overpowered but have only two tiers of health at the very
    beginning.
    .
    In the 'arcade' mode, the player should defeat all six opponents (including his
    clone) in a specified order. Only nine continues are available for this type of
    game.
    .
    'Conquest' mode, in its' turn, proposes the player to choose one of two preset
    teams, with each having three characters. After the choice is done, the player
    has to decide which enemy's fortress he should siege. Once the fortress is
    selected, the attacker's staying on his own, while the defending side has Shi
    Ren, Xie Seng and the actual "defender" (stage "owner") appearing in the same
    defined order, King of Fighters style. Should only the attacker defeat one of
    the opponents, his health's being fully restored. Once all three opponent's
    fortresses fall, the player wins.

    .
    Using 2D side-scrolling graphics with a distinct cartoony design, the player
    takes control of a single fighter as he attempts to defeat his opponent in
    single-round fights. Combat is controlled with a single attack button which can
    unleash all sorts of moves when pressed in conjunction with the directional
    arrows. These moves vary among each fighter, as players can choose from 15
    different fighters, each with their own stats and moves, and then compete
    against the others to see who gets the honor of becoming grandmaster.
    .
    Additionally the game includes a story mode in which players can take control of
    a single martial artist and roam the countryside looking for challengers (the
    later done from a top-down map view). Starting abilities and health are minimal,
    but successfully defeating opponents will increase the player's health and allow
    the fighter to learn new moves and turn into the ultimate combatant.

  description:
    In Nantettatte!! Baseball you control one of 16 cartoon-styled teams and try to
    lead them on to victory. The gameplay is simple and similar to many other
    baseball games released on the NES, with five ways to play. You can play a
    versus mode against either the computer or a partner, take a team through a
    season of between 30 and 130 games in hopes of winning the pennant, play a
    multiplayer tournament, or play a home run derby and try to knock as many balls
    as you can out of the park. There's also an edit mode where you can configure
    your team for the Pennant Mode, and a "Watch" mode where you can watch a
    CPU-controlled match.
    .
    Each of the sixteen teams, just like actual baseball teams, have strengths and
    weaknesses. Seven of the teams also have designated hitters, who replace
    pitchers when it's their turn at bat. All teams also have eight starters, who
    can be switched out at any point (but cannot be switched back). The teams can
    play in either one of four stadiums, which all are basically the same.

    help him to awaken the dragons and to defeat the monsters.

    This is a traditional action platform game. Asmik can jump and exhale steam from
    his nostrils to turn all his enemies into eggs. Those eggs can be eaten and
    later used for various purposes (during boss battles, acquiring upgrades at a
    shop that becomes available once you have completed a stage, etc.). Asmik dies
    if he comes into close contact with an enemy. Boss battles differ from the rest
    of the game, each one being a mini-game of its own, for example a
    rock-paper-scissors game during which Asmik uses his correct choices to gain

    heroes to step in and fix things? That's where the four Dice Heroes step in. The
    four Dice Heroes will, of course, be under your control.

    fighter, he's got a moderately high amount of strength, and a decent balance of
    everything. There's the dwarf, who's got plenty of strength and endurance, but
    he's dumb as a brick. There's the elf, who's really good at magic but has no HP
    and very little strength. Then there's the half-elf, who's fair and balanced.

    is the currency of the world and can be spent in the convenience store of each
    town to increase abilities and buy new weapons. Some of these include throwing

    special powers. Towns also contain people who will give clues and information to
    Jack & Ryu.

    turn, commands are given to Jack & Ryu, which include usage of special items and
    skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those
    commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one
    side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.

  developer: Yutaka
  publisher: Yutaka
  description:
    The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know
    it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations
    of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has
    mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders
    of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their
    existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the
    chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien
    invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more
    about the tragic fate of humanity.
    .
    Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic  Final Fantasy. Instead
    of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party
    of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious
    robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person
    perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies.
    The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special
    skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with
    more powerful skills.
    .
    Dungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person
    perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some
    of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party
    quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.

    your way through various thugs to rescue Iron Man and the Vision. This game is a
    side scroller, somewhat reminiscent of Bionic Commando in which you fight
    through a level then move to an overhead map to decide where to go next. In
    between levels, Wasp gives you hints.
    .
    Captain America's attacks are: when he is standing, shield throw; when he is
    crouching, punch and when he is jumping, kick. Also, if you push twice in a
    direction, Cap can do a powerful forward charge with his shield for a short
    distance.

    Hawkeye's attacks are all arrow shots. He can shoot left, right, up, upper-left
    or upper-right.

    If you complete an area with one character then complete it with the other
    character right away, you can press start to switch between Cap or Hawkeye. This

    King Ogreth of the Basam Empire has invaded your country and either captured or
    turned into rocks and trees all your soldiers. You, king Suren, are left
    completely alone. In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's
    castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your
    soldiers back to you...
    .
    In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple – just walk a distance of 600
    meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into
    trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some
    knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers.
    King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the
    battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units.
    So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand
    (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.).
    If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the
    beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.

  game: Hissatsu Shigoto Nin

  developer: Banpresto
  publisher: Banpresto
  description:
    Hissatsu Shigotonin roughly translates to Deadly Work People. I found this name
    to be pretty strange, but once I started understanding what this game was all
    about, it made sense. It was released December 15, 1990 exclusively in Japan for
    the Famicom. It turns out Hissatsu Shigotonin is actually biased off of the
    popular Japanese historical drama TV series of the same name. The story of both
    focus on a group of ordinary "work people" who live double lives as assassins.
    It is an alternate Feudal Japan history (1603-1863) featuring fictional
    characters with elements of a parallel world. You must uncover a mystery though
    out the game, which comes though the story in episodes like the TV show. The
    player controls Nakamura Mondo, a fictional character who is also the star of
    the TV show. The game is biased on the original 84 episode run/first season of
    the TV series from 1979-1981 but features characters all the way up to the
    gameâ€™s release date. The show continues to this day with Assassins as a
    subtitle. This seems like a really cool concept for a weekly episodic series.
    The story has an almost assassins creed feel. Iâ€™m sure the idea of everyday
    people turned into warriors has been around in stories forever, but the setting
    and time period makes it stand out. Japanâ€™s feudal era is one of the most
    intense of all the time periods in earthâ€™s history. It was a time of Samurai,
    Ninja and technology that eventually killed off said Samurai and Ninja. One of
    the biggest draws of the era is the is the fantastic culture that knew of the
    outside world, but worked hard in maintaining isolation making them truly
    unique. The main character, Nakamura Mondo, is a corrupt cop known for accepting
    bribes who is disrespected by his superiors, and mother-in-law. He ends up
    bringing together a group of people that have all been wronged in some way,
    formed to solve mysteries and assassinate targets. The heroes play by the same
    rules as the villains, as they are not afraid to use underhanded tactics to get
    the job done. Each episode of the show usually climaxes with the killing of the
    target, sometimes in an almost humorous manner such as a flower through the
    skull. I was able to find a random episode but no dubs or subs, which is a
    bummer since I wanted to learn more of the story. It seems to hold up well to
    time, has a campy feel to it and comes off like a live action anime. Check out
    this trailer for one of their many movies to get a better idea of the style,
    think Al Bundy the Samuri and his gang of misfits.

    Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon
    Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary
    Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the
    son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting.
    Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the
    appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the
    king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.
    .
    Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the
    overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random
    encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members
    receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough
    experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you
    travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed
    at night.
    .
    You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three
    more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current
    characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are
    divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and
    wizard.
    .
    The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired
    characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base
    class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage
    class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches
    classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but
    retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create
    powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight
    effectively.

  description:
    Unlike its namesake, the IndyCar racer  Al Unser Jr., this game depicts Formula
    1 races. A season consists of sixteen races, each one consisting of unlimited
    practice, one qualifying lap and the real race (the starting position depends on
    the qualifying result). Of course the goal is to win the championship by having
    successful race results. Those results also change the amount of "set-up
    points", which represent the quality of the car, players can use before the next
    race. Besides the championship there is also a time trial mode available (with
    or without AI opponents).
    .
    While the game features manual gear switching, it tends more to an action
    oriented gameplay than a simulation: pit stops (needed when the car gets nearly
    destroyed after accidents) stop the time for every driver and players can use a
    limited amount of turbo boosts. Players can start their own racing team or play
    as Al Unser Jr., which results in always having the best car possible.

    Unlike most platformers, momentum is very important in Kid Kool.  He takes
    several steps to get up to full speed when running and cannot stop on a dime.
    There is no air control, so how far he is able to jump depends entirely on how
    fast he was going when he left the ground.

    Kool faces a variety of enemies.  They can be defeated by jumping on their
    heads.  The first jump drives them into the ground and the second eliminates
    them.  They also can be beaten with a furry companion that Kool can pick up by
    running fast enough past the appropriate spots.  He can be thrown with the B
    button, then retrieved by standing near him.  He also affords some protection as
    if Kool is hit while holding him, he will only lose his companion, not a life.

  description:
    The Kingdom of Badham was once the host of the legendary Wing of Madoola bird
    statue. Anyone who possessed the wing would be granted tremendous power. Many
    wars were caused by nations wanting to have control over this powerful artifact.
    Thankfully, a king of the Rameru family gained possession of the wing and
    ordered that it be hidden away in a cave so peace would finally reign between
    the warring nations, and peace did indeed reign, for a while at least. Hundreds
    of years later, a descendant of the king, named Darutos, stumbled upon the
    location of the wing and decided to use it for his own ends. He summoned demons
    to take over his family's castle to claim it as solely his own. The remaining
    Rameru family line now have formed an alliance to gain back the castle and put a
    stop to Darutos. They decided there only hope is a magic wielding warrior named
    Lucia.

    The Black Onyx is the very first RPG made by a Japanese company. It is similar
    in gameplay to early Wizardry and Ultima games with killing monsters and
    exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. You create a party (up to five
    members) and explore a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way.
    You also meet adventurers whom you can convince to join your party. The combat

    Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a
    planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.
    .
    But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some
    kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and
    get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure,
    starts its countdown.
    .
    There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit
    code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors
    in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid
    self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an
    energy ball.
    .
    Crackout is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most
    singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls
    surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing
    the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of
    enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will
    make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier
    by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the
    clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device
    (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the
    weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret
    parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.

    Stick Hunter: Exciting Ice Hockey is a game for the Famicom released only in
    Japan in 1987. It was never released in North America. Stick Hunter was the
    first actual ice hockey game created for a Nintendo gaming system.
    .
    The game was designed so that 1 player could play against the computer, or 2
    players could play simultaneously against each other. The length of the periods
    and difficulty level could both be adjusted.
    .
    Playing as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not
    only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward. So if the player
    wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing
    the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and
    attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing
    net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had
    control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate.
    .
    As in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the
    opposing team.

    It is here that the game begins in earnest, and the most familiar hallmark of
    the ADV genre begins to rear its head: busywork. The player needs to look at and
    interact with everything they possibly can if they want to make any progress,
    often multiple times. The lengths of which the game goes to to pad itself out is
    often ridiculous, such as when Shiro is only able to visit his own workplace

    lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder,
    forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be
    helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you.

    sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the

    Palamedes II can be described as "its predecessor, turned upside down". As

    elimination. Only series of dice such as 4-4-4-4-4 or 1-2-3-4-5 can be
    eliminated, and depending on the series, this will result in one or several rows
    of dice to be eliminated from the screen. Unlike the original Palamedes, this
    time your character stands on top of the dice, and the growing pile of dice will
    crush him unless he makes the correct combinations to eliminate the pile. It's a
    bit like Tetris, and a bit like Klax.
    .
    Two modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which
    must be eliminated. It can be played alone (single), against another human
    (match) or in a quest against the computer.
    .
    Mode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the
    stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to
    make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of
    the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the
    bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to
    reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one
    in your pile. Due to the nature of mode 2, it can't be played alone, only in
    match or quest mode.

    .
    As the dictatorial ruler of the Epsilon Galaxy, the player has obtained
    complete, indisputable authority. However, during a scientific experiment in
    hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four "buffer" dimensions,
    each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy
    and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these
    alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own
    experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these
    buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact.
    .
    To make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase
    terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds
    which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds,
    desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically
    balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to
    generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine
    for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct
    spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy
    battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The
    player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end
    goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by
    conquering these four new dimensions before the player can.
    .
    The player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the
    hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the
    player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located.
    Politically (at the very least), this is not an option.

    touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he
    kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be
    used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave
    behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word "CAPTAIN

    Jim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that

    allows Jim to jump higher; and the "coffee?" power-up, which enables Jim to
    shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.

    There is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the
    next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the

    Taking place 100 years before the events of Castlevania 1 and Castlevania 2,
    Dracula the Vampire has risen up to threaten the small village of Warakiya.
    Citizens who had banished the Belmont family now beg for Trevor Belmont's help
    in slaying Dracula. In his strange castle, Dracula has been assembling a massive
    army of undead creatures to sweep the Earth clean of life and bring everlasting
    darkness. Trevor agrees to help and equips his family's hereditary whip, the
    "Vampire Slayer", in order to destroy Dracula.
    .
    Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse is a side-scrolling platform game. The gameplay
    is nearly identical to the first Castlevania game. The player takes the role of
    Trevor Belmont who is able to move left and right, jump, attack with his whip
    straight ahead and use a special weapon. These special weapons consume hearts,
    which can be found by defeating monsters or destroying candles. Power-ups
    include: a throwing dagger, a throwing axe, A time-stopping stopwatch, a
    cross-shaped boomerang and a vial of holy water. Additionally there is a double
    shot (II) and triple shot (III) power-up which increases the number of special
    weapons that can be used at one time. Trevor is defeated if his life meter runs
    out, and can find a roast turkey power-up to replenish it. Trevor progresses
    through each level defeating monsters and eventually encountering a boss
    creature. At different points in the game the player will be able to chose
    between different paths, which will determine which levels are played.
    .
    At the end of certain levels, the player may encounter a companion which can be
    recruited. Only one companion can accompany Trevor at any time; accepting a new
    companion means rejecting the existing one. Once recruited, Trevor can change
    between his own form and that of the companion. Each companion has an
    independent life meter and has unique abilities such as powerful magic, the
    ability to climb walls or flight. These abilities may also affect the types of
    power-ups that appear in candles and the exact function of special weapons.

    and continues the story of the first Dragon Ball Z RPG,  Assault of Saiyajins.
    After the fight against the Saiyajin leader Vegeta, Son Goku, the series' main
    hero, is heavily wounded, while his ally Piccolo is dead. Son Goku's son Son
    Gohan and his friends go to the planet Namek to find the magical Dragon Balls

    planet, and so does the evil Freezer, who is also after the Dragon Balls...

    through them in a board-game-like fashion, drawing cards that will determine the
    amount of moves you can make. Random cards will also make you participate in
    battles, heal your party, add extra cards, etc. In battles you also depend on

    by Japanese manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori which was published in Sh?nen
    Magazine, as well as being aired on television. The story takes place in a world
    plagued by Shocker, a mysterious terrorist organization. To further its plans
    for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning
    their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However,
    one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With
    his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the
    grasshopper-themed altered human superhero Kamen Rider. Another of Shocker's
    victims, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, had also been given cyborg
    implants, but was saved by Kamen Rider from the brainwashing process to become
    Kamen Rider #2. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI
    agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions
    against both Shocker and its successor organization Gel-Shocker.

    Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion,

    Radically different from other racquet sports such as tennis, badminton uses a
    high-drag shuttle which gives it an irregular path. In this video game
    adaptation, the player controls the Japanese player in a competition against
    five opponents: Canada, USA, UK, South Korea and China. Each match is played on
    best-of-five sets, played to 15 (boys) or 11 (girls) points. Four different
    courts can be chosen.

    Along the d-pad, two buttons are used to control the player - one to swing the
    racquet, and other to jump. By following the shadow of the shuttle the player
    can position himself correctly, and then hit it in perfect timing, giving it
    enough power and lift to reach the opponent's side, and then (hopefully) descend
    out of the opponent's reach. Jumping allows the player to hit the shuttle
    downwards but still over the net, reducing the reaction time for a proper return

  description:
    Tetsuya Wakatsuki was just an average guy, lazy but well-meaning, and a
    photographer for the local newspaper. Your planet being attacked by an invading
    alien armada tends to change that sort of thing, though. The young princess of
    the invading army, Kahm, comes to Earth to take part in the annihilation of the
    human race. She ends up stranded on Earth, where Tetsuya finds her, and they
    fall for each other.
    .
    They decide that if they were to get married, the two planets would no longer be
    able to fight, and so they set off for Kahm's home planet to seek permission
    from her father, the emperor. Having been the one who ordered the invasion in
    the first place, though, he is not particularly pleased with this turn of
    events. Tetsuya is imprisoned, and Kahm is taken away to places unknown. Now,
    Tetsuya must break out of prison and rescue Kahm!
    .
    Outlanders is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being
    just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only
    equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a
    gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao,
    who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who
    will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found
    and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system
    to save progress.

    The game's battles play out in turn-based formations, and each formation acts
    separately and can target different formations on the enemy's side. For
    instance, the archers can aim for any of the four rows of enemy forces, though
    front-line melee fighters are far more limited.

    option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set
    pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be
    practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4
    attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you
    will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league
    consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched
    but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style.
    There is 12 different referees in the game.

    The full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery,

    allowed onto the next one.

    Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire
    when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing -
    though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing
    a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing
    graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas
    the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.
    .
    If the player wants to go to the next event or round, they will have to qualify
    by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum targets.

    Ryohi. Juan's last request was for Ryohi to visit Shorinji. Gengai, the bishop
    of Shorinji, took the young Ryohi under his wing.  Six years later, a letter of
    challenge is sent from the Tusk Soldiers, who are the enemies of Shorinji, The
    letter mentions the upcoming "World Tournament of Contact Sports". Ryuhi decides

    enemies (the screen turns black when they appear)  that must be defeated because
    they drop items that must be collected in order to continue on. The items they

    Colossus, Iceman and Nightcrawler, are ready to fight Magneto.
    .
    The Uncanny X-Men is an over-head view action game. Players begin by choosing
    two X-Men from the roster (the second either controlled by another player or the
    computer) and select one of five levels including a practice level. The goal in
    each level is to reach the hidden 'command center' and destroy it. The X-Men all
    share similar abilities, being able to move in any direction, jump and attack.
    Half of the characters (Storm, Iceman, Cyclops) have long range attacks while
    the other half (Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus) must get in close range to
    punch the enemies. Each X-men can only sustain a certain number of hits before
    being defeated. Should the two X-Men both fall in battle, players will be able
    to choose two more to attempt the level again until all of the X-Men are used
    up.
    .
    Power-ups include an "S" which stops time, invincibility for a short time and a
    health restore. There is also a Magnet (symbol of Magneto) power-down which
    renders the X-men immobile for a short time.

    Minelvaton Saga: Ragon no Fukkatsu is a Role Playing Game first in the
    Minelvaton series, being followed by Silva Saga and ending with Silva Saga II:
    The Legend of Light and Darkness.\n
    Minelvaton Saga takes place on the world Minelvaton, in the area known as
    Southern Ofelia. In the kingdom of Palmeccia both the King and Queen have been
    murdered by the hands of a servant of Ragon, son of the Zuhl. The player takes
    control of the Prince of Palmeccia in a quest for revenge and to kill the evil
    Ragon.\n
    Fundamentally, the game plays and looks like Dragon Quest. The player is given
    control of a single character and can explore a number of towns, dungeons, and
    the world map itself. However, once the player receives the ship for sailing,
    the game becomes non-linear as the player can explore almost anywhere that can
    be reached.\n
    Another unique feature is the battle system. Like a typical RPG, there are
    random battles, but actual combat resembles a sort of action RPG. In battle, the
    player starts at the bottom of the screen facing the enemies that are at the
    top. In order to defeat enemies, the player must run into one in order to
    exchange blows. The closest analog to this unusual system is the MMORPG, or the
    MMORPG-ish single player game Final Fantasy XII.\n
    Beyond that, the basic plot and some of the battle system concept seems to have
    been co-opted by Sega's Sword of Vermilion.

    Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Yjutsushi (lit. Deep Dungeon IV: The Black Sorcerer) is
    the fourth and final installment in the Deep Dungeon series. Unfortunately this
    game has removed the custom character feature of the previous game. Through the
    game, the player will meet up to two additional playable characters with
    predetermined class. This game also reverts to the standard practice or
    randomizing characters' stat growth when gaining an experience level. New to
    this engine is that the player can eventually learn to summon two monsters to
    function as a temporary additional party member for a single battle. It also
    removed the feature that stops random battles when the player is significantly
    more powerful than the enemies. This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in
    this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor
    dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor,
    or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the
    player can accept "requests" from the non-player characters. These are optional
    tasks that will reward the player with bonus items, experience or money when

  description:
    Long ago, back in the days of cavemen and dinosaurs, there was a land called Og.
    In this land, hungry one-eyed cavemen, called Trogs, loved the taste of eggs.
    However, two Dino-Mites, Spike and Bloop, were determined to rescue the eggs
    from certain doom!
    .
    Up to two players can play in a race to gather up the Trog eggs as quickly as
    possible.  The first player to get all eggs of their colour wins the round.  Of
    course, Trogs also love the taste of Spike and Bloop, and will use cavemen
    inventions such as fire and the wheel to catch them and gobble them up!
    Luckily, the Dinos can fight back - eating a pineapple will turn them into a
    monstrous T-Rex that can chow down on Trogs, while a hot tamale lets them
    breathe fire.

    prototypes were discovered and purchased in a lot by the Nolan brothers, who
    released the most complete ROM to the public.\n
    Kitty's Catch is a two-player game where players control cats named Pitter and
    Patter, and have to catch fish with their tails. The first player to fill their
    bucket with fish gets a shell, and the player with the most shells at the end of

    level) and diffuse it. In addition to doorways and walls, transporters can also
    be found in the maze. These will instantly teleport you to a new location, and

    otherwise dead ends. Different types of Deathbots guard the passages; and you'll
    need to use the various weapons you find lying about to get past them, before
    they destroy you. You have a limited amount of energy. Each time you are hit by
    enemy fire or by a Deathbot, your energy depletes. Lose all of of your energy
    and a life is lost. And of course, each level ends with a large boss Deathbot.

    and usurped the throne, initiating a dark era of tyranny. But one of the king's
    guards, Radley, took the young heir of the throne and brought him securely to
    Damascus, where he grows up. Realizing he is the true prince of the Littleland
    dynasty, the young hero follows Radley's instructions and sets on a quest to
    find seven magical rainbow pieces, which alone will be able to destroy Zrool.

    increases, and you are able to trade items by buying them in one town and
    selling in another. Trading is the only effective way of getting money in the

  developer: Taito

  description:
    You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret
    documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the
    basement of the building.
    .
    Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only
    one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which
    Agent 17 can kill them:
    .
    1. Shooting them with his gun.\n
    2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.\n
    3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto
    one of them.\n
    4. Crushing them with an elevator.
    .
    Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period
    of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways
    that are already dark.
    .
    While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up
    or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a
    bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will
    move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is
    able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as
    possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an
    elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall.
    .
    Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are
    the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or
    down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.
    .
    Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents.
    If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot
    escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the
    documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.
    .
    If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and
    he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react.
    Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses
    a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may
    also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for
    Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an
    elevator.

  description:
    Eliminator Boat Duel is a ruthless one on one boat racing game that can either
    be played against the computer or a human opponent. The races take place in such
    settings as open water, the bayou, and even industrial water districts. Each
    boat race consists of several sections. First, there is the starting line --
    where you can expect a $2000 fine for a false start -- which begins with a brief
    side-scrolling race with split-screen background scrolling, a common
    characteristic of later NES titles. The primary sections of the races are a
    mixture of top-down racing and 3rd-person racing from a perspective behind the
    boats. The top-down sections are the most involved with numerous threats to
    avoid such as alligators, sharks, and whirlpools that will turn you the wrong
    way. There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed
    boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have
    less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay
    within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp. Speed
    boosts are collected along the way and can be used at the player's discretion to
    gain a much-needed edge at any point during the race.
    .
    A race finishes back in the side-scrolling view. If the boats come through too
    close together, the bikini models on the sidelines act confused and request a
    slo-mo replay, which the game subsequently provides. Prize money is then awarded
    with which the players may use to repair and upgrade their boats with faster
    engines, tougher hulls, and better steering.

  description:
    Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen (Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai
    Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a
    youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong.
    The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is
    missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights
    for peace between humans and yÅkai, which generally involves protecting the
    former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of
    Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is
    not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.
    .
    Gegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights
    are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the
    sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins.
    However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and
    challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to
    survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and
    rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience
    points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to
    compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by
    comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience
    points.
    .
    The map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan,
    along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore
    the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the
    onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He
    must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through
    Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new
    regions on the island until some task has been completed first.

  description:
    April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is
    kidnapped by the villainous Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and Rocksteady.
    The four ninja turtles: Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo fight
    their way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to rescue April. They battle
    familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag from
    Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final showdown with
    Shredder himself.
    .
    Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game is a port of the popular arcade
    game made by Konami during the height of the cartoon series' popularity.
    Depending on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take
    part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most
    of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with
    knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level,
    players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such
    as Bebop and Rocksteady).
    .
    The NES version of the game features additional content not present in other
    versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new
    bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly), additional music
    tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.

  description:
    Deep Dungeon III: Yuushi he no Tabi. Deep Dungeon III: The Journey to the Hero
    is the third installment in the Deep Dungeon series and the first to be released
    on the Famicom. This is the first Deep Dungeon title to offer the player a world
    to explore spanning multiple dungeons and multiple towns. It also allows the
    player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the
    hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character.
    Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will
    only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable
    character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as
    the protagonist "swordsman" character is defeated. This game retains the
    player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature
    that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher
    experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and
    rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player
    character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's
    turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player
    another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money
    (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter
    maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want
    to gold farm.

    Battletank is an advanced tank simulator where players take control of a tank
    from its driver's seat. Players are stuck straight in the tank and sent off to
    the battlefield in order to accomplish the mission they are assigned to.
    .
    Mission objectives.can be anything from eliminating the enemies to destroying
    the enemy fuel dump to taking out an enemy camp.  However dangerous enemies lurk
    all over the battlefield.  Helicopters, minefields and other tanks wait to block
    your moves.  These enemies can move off-screen and strafe around the tank,
    leading to difficulties.
    .
    However, many strategic elements are involved.  The first-person mode offers a
    limited view of the battlefield, and if players push the tank into overdrive it
    can miss the target and rush into a nest of tanks or a minefield.  Turret angle,
    ammunition, and tank fuel remaining must all be taken into account by the
    player.  To add to this, certain guns on the tank (there's 4 of them) will only
    hurt certain enemies.  But don't expect any help here!  Six hits and your tank
    is cooked!

  description:
    Based on the animé series Ushio & Tora, this game tells the story of a boy named
    Ushio. He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line
    stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was
    terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China,
    managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the
    demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make
    sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the
    basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on
    the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which
    attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a
    tiger (Tora is Japanese for tiger). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he
    holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will!
    .
    The game plays like a traditional console-style RPG, with turn-based battles,
    where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities. You explore
    Tokyo by moving Ushio around from top-down perspective, and inside houses and
    dungeons the view switches to first-person, like in early "interactive fiction"
    adventures.
    .
    Ushio to Tora: Shinen no Daiyo is a Japan-only release and is not the same game
    as the SNES action title "Ushio & Tora".

    example you see an enemy to the left of the penguin you are not controlling, you
    have to fire to the right in order to hit it. You have to reach the top of the
    level in such a way that the two penguins will arrive at the top square at the

    As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated
    mission-based plot: Thief, Mage, Fighter or Cleric. Each class, to a certain
    extent, has a different approach for completing quests.
    .
    In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various "mini-games" that are needed
    to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild
    master. These mini-games include, but are not limited to:
    .
    1. Fighting at the Arena (3rd Person Perspective)\n
    Competing at the Archery Range (1st Person Perspective)\n
    Exploring buildings or mazes (Top-down Perspective)\n
    Riding a horse while avoiding obstacles (3rd Person

    Locking picking doors and chests (1st Person Perspective)

    for the story and the cast of characters which you use throughout the game. Each
    character possesses different attributes, including their jumping ability, their
    ability to hover in mid-air, and their strength. As in the arcade, some
    characters must be rescued in order to make them playable. This game boasts over
    50 household items which serve as animated enemies throughout each level. The
    game was never sold outside of Japan, or translated from Japanese to any other
    language.\n
    Akio, being a member of the Esper Corps organization which supposedly fights
    Evil all over the world. His task is quite simple - save his friends and
    somebody else from the Devil's Castle with his formidable hammer and...
    enormously jumpy feet... (you'll see what I mean when you play it). The game is
    quite lengthy and mazy at places, so do talk to strange dwellers of that place
    (don't be afraid to use the START button to talk).
