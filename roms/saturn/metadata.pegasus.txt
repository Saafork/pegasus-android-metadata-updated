  description:
    Flash backwards to several years before the vicious battle against the empire in
    Panzer Dragoon 1. In the country of Machania, dragons are bred for the exclusive
    use of the dragoons, or Knights. Dragons with wings are normally executed as
    they are deemed to be a bad omen by the citizens. In the war with the Empire,
    Machania has begun to examine the ancient ways rather than to try to fight a
    futile war using technological advances. The Empire is technologically more
    advanced. Randy, the hero, and his newfound friend, the dragon he saved, want to
    turn the tide of battle.

    Sonic 3D Blast, also known as Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island, is a 1996 platform
    video game developed by Traveller's Tales and Sonic Team, and published by Sega
    for the Genesis, Saturn, and Windows. Part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the
    game abandons previous Sonic games' side-scrolling style in favor of isometric
    gameplay, making use of some pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites. The
    game features creatures known as Flickies, which first appeared in the 1984
    arcade game Flicky. Controlling only Sonic himself, the player's goal is to
    collect Flickies and carry them to safety, periodically sparring with the series
    antagonist Dr. Robotnik, who is imprisoning them within robots.
    .
    While 3D Blast was initially created for the Genesis Sega also commissioned a
    port for the Saturn as a backup plan in case Sonic X-treme could not be released
    in time for the Holiday season.

    This is the home port of the popular arcade light gun game. This home version

    a light gun (or a mouse, if available) you blast your way through the secret
    base, Area 51, which has been taken over by mutant aliens.
    .
    As you work your way to the secrets at the heart of Area 51, you'll need to
    destroy an increasingly dangerous line of aliens, upgrade your firearm, and
    cause as much collateral damage as possible. The game rewards the player for
    destroying windows, light fixtures, computers, explosive barrels, and even fire
    extinguishers. Each consecutive hit increases your streak rating (which adds to
    your score) and certain combinations of these collateral hits will open up
    secret bonus rooms.

  game: Shining Force III
  file: Shining Force III (USA) (Beta).chd
  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots
    of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story
    starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you
    must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind
    behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be
    taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.
    .
    The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone
    who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also
    be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D
    characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled
    like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to
    NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the
    Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences.
    .
    The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique
    "friendship" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each
    other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to
    give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as
    the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear,
    spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is
    going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully
    intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be
    very comfortable with the combat system.
    .
    It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force
    III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series
    of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of
    Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the
    storyline.

  description:
    Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon
    games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.
    .
    The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The
    Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to
    discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of
    present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young
    girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden,
    one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge
    begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of
    his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also
    after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or
    are there more?
    .
    "Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't
    have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact
    the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D
    world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot.
    During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special
    attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to
    attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks.
    The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will
    be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available
    dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.

  game: Magic Carpet

  developer: Electronic Arts
  publisher: Electronic Arts
  description:
    Magic Carpet is a first-person perspective game, in which you are a mage who
    flies on a, well, magic carpet and casts spells. The game has 50 levels, called
    "worlds"; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous
    islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to
    "restore the equilibrium" within the world. Once this happens, you can head to
    the next level.
    .
    To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and
    cast a specific spell to make it "yours". To collect this mana, you have to use
    a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will
    appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level
    and collect "your" mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won't be able
    to hold much mana, so you'll have to keep casting the "castle" spell at it to
    make it bigger.
    .
    The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can
    hurt you with their attacks, but killing them is often necessary, as upon death
    they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level. To attack
    your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs,
    lightning bolts and meteors.
    .
    There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal
    yourself, surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a
    skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting
    landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the beginning, though.
    .
    Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3
    dimensions. You can bring up a top-down map at any time.

    Hardcore 4x4 (initially known as TNN Motorsports Hardcore 4X4 in the US and
    known as Deka Yonku ~Tough The Truck~in Japan) is a racing video game developed
    by Gremlin Interactive for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Microsoft Windows.
    It became available for download from PlayStation Store as a PSone Classic for
    play on the PlayStation 3 on January 10, 2008, in PAL regions.[4] The game
    utilizes 3D environments and truck models. The soundtrack features hard rock
    music. It was the first game to feature vehicles with independent
    suspension.[citation needed]
    .
    In 1996, ASC (publisher) hired Top Dog Entertainment in Austin, Texas, to
    develop Hardcore 4x4 II (the second version). The first Sony PlayStation
    developer in the Americas, Brett Butler, was lead programmer. He travelled to
    England to collect the game code and world builder tools. Both were defective,
    so he spent the first month repairing the code base. He then designed new
    tracks, rebuilt the graphics engine in MIPS RISC R3000 assembly, and hired
    artists and designers to create new tracks, menu interfaces, and vehicles. The
    title was completed in late 1997 as Top Dog went out of business shortly after
    Brett Butler left the company.[citation needed]

  game: Winter Heat
  file: Winter Heat (USA).chd
  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    Winter Heat is the home conversion of the DecAthlete (also known as Athlete
    Kings) sequel, replacing decathlon by Winter sports. Competition (in Arcade,
    Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of
    different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani,
    Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who
    appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena).
    .
    The game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx
    but with a more arcade feel. The events include:
    .
    1. Speed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as
    fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button
    to gain speed.
    .
    2. Ski Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain
    speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain
    extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose
    valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).
    .
    3. Downhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to
    miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight
    path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump
    hills perfectly.
    .
    4. Short Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad
    controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the
    pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second
    position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to
    reach fastest speeds with less button presses.
    .
    5. Skeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up
    followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's
    possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete
    can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.
    .
    6. Slalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom.
    After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach
    each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late
    will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.
    .
    7. Aerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a "click-along"
    version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three
    parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed
    button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action
    button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the
    speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player
    must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses
    .
    8. Bobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow
    down.
    .
    9. Speed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed
    must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few
    seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the
    power bar.
    .
    10. Snowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to
    be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a
    gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.
    .
    11. Cross Country:\n
    The stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be
    taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of
    speed without losing stamina.

    With disregard for a background story, Funcom Dublin offers a Wipeout-esque mix

    Contrary to the aforementioned title, you drive ordinary racing cars, if you
    count out the mounted weapons. These include mines, concussion missiles, smart
    bombs, heat-seeking missiles, lasers and firewalls. Some are provided by taking
    out enemies, but power-ups, time bonuses, energy, armor and a handicap that
    turns the screen upside-down, can also be collected.
    .
    Five cars are available, with different statistics and built-in weapons. The
    initially weak weapon is soon replaced when you collect upgrade icons. To
    activate these, you have to complete a bonus stage after which you can also save
    your game. To add to the game's length, each of the twelve tracks, based on the
    settings "city", "mountain" or "space", has three variations: reverse, at night
    or the combination of the two. Other features include a small diagram showing

    Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a
    basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.
    .
    The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to
    fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the
    help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours,
    two-on-two and three-on-three.
    .
    Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on
    the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is
    a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about
    five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.
    .
    The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player
    versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode.
    In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps,
    you can actually have a three-on-three game.

    There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds.
    These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's
    similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired
    and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.
    .
    The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic
    Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five
    matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of
    the team is substituted in and out.
    .
    There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory
    cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.

    Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using
    less mechs or smaller mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.)
    and you'll get chance at a promotion trial where you face superior odds in an
    arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can
    make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!
    .
    Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their
    original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and
    mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns.
    Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different
    weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the "par" force
    in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this
    was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than
    anything that came before. Let addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each
    other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were created to take
    advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's
    nonetheless a classic.

    constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The
    first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp
    crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on
    you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as
    the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second
    stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering
    skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau
    will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet

    This game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is

    of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to
    any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the
    level is complete. One result of this change that may appear strange to players
    of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top of the visible
    playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and start travelling
    back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the
    playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of
    moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line).

  game: Guardian Heroes

  description:
    Treasure's unique scrolling beat-em-up/RPG hybrid, Guardian Heroes introduces
    the player to a motley crew of heroes (Consisting of a swordsman, a ninja, a
    cleric and a mage), formed to find a "legendary sword". The game begins with the
    heroes in a bar, having found this sword, as they decide what to do with it.
    Before they have a chance to come up with an idea however, they are interrupted
    as an Imperial General charges in and warns them they are in grave danger.
    Seconds later, Imperial troops swarm into the inn and the heroes are forced to
    take flight along with this general.
    .
    The fighting mechanic is slightly deeper than the average scrolling beat-em-up,
    with light and heavy attacks, special moves (executed the same way you'd expect
    a normal beat-em-up to work), magical attacks and the ability to block. As you
    defeat enemies you gain experience points, with which you can upgrade your
    character between levels - sharing them between various factors such as
    strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.
    .
    Even more interesting however is the hugely branching storyline, which changes
    according to decisions you make (of which there are many) and which character
    you select to play with.
    .
    Also of note is the fact that even in one-player mode there are always two of
    you on screen - you command the other character by changing his "mood" -
    aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six. On top of this, it is
    possible to play the game as a more traditional beat-em-up with up to six
    players/bots, and in this mode you can play as any character that you have
    encountered during the main game mode.

    school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves.
    Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.
    .
    The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom
    combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you
    can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in
    total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)

    Jewels of the Oracle is a stationary puzzle game with no real story line or

    others. Most of them can be played in two difficulty levels (Easy or Hard), and
    the Oracle provides clues to help along the way.

    The graphics for the puzzles are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style.
    Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off,
    if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle's well.
    There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where

    which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.

  game: Amok
  file: Amok (USA).chd
  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the
    manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by
    the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between
    them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and
    theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea,
    and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been
    reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a
    blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people." The
    agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known
    only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot
    named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts
    of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the
    role of Gert Staun.
    .
    Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding
    it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the
    "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird
    can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between
    the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in
    either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to
    such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the
    Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically
    scripted, however. The player  has no power to control this transformation or
    alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when
    Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.
    .
    The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do
    so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear
    structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all
    sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases,
    power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and
    huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be
    killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be
    able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing
    pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport
    vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a
    variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive
    weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two
    laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons
    are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create
    complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly
    wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically
    used instead of missiles.

    This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those
    who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road
    Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the
    race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to
    cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if
    they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the
    same to you during the next race that takes place.
    .
    There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway,
    Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as
    the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops
    driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike
    near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your
    bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for
    damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding.
    Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again
    another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five
    circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.
    .
    There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups.
    Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you
    proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike
    class.
    .
    If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash
    mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money
    involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against
    fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to
    start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in
    the last place.
    .
    The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the
    races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists,
    including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs
    can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.

    marks the series' jump to three-dimensional graphics and controversial changes
    in gameplay. Legacy of War was released packaged with a pair of 3D anaglyph
    glasses, which the game supported. Legacy of War bears the distinction for being
    the first console game in the series to retain both the Contra title and human
    characters during its release in Europe and Australia (where the console series
    has been known as Probotector from the first NES game and up until Contra: Hard

  developer: Altron

  description:
    Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When
    you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the
    color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely
    cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed
    and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.
    .
    Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks.
    To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours.
    Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues
    on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a
    few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there
    are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons
    and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e.
    damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of "boss" robot is put
    in your way. These "bosses" use special weapons that only they have access to.
    Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be
    incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters,
    save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your
    cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some
    one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!
    .
    The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up
    different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on
    your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out
    means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square
    and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers
    your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have
    different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.

    Galactic Attack is a coin-op conversion of the Japanese arcade game RayForce

    mountain ranges, each with their own standard huge bosses at the end of each of
    these levels. The player takes control of a starfighter called the RVA-818
    X-LAY, out to destroy any opposing forces.
    .
    The story has the future of Earth governments gathering together to construct a
    massive super computer called Con-Human to help with the planet's environment,
    providing nutrients to the earth and caring for the ecosystem. However, a cloned
    human is linked with the system and makes Con-Human a sentient being. The system
    eventually becomes insane and starts to create natural disasters, wiping all
    nearly all of mankind and destroying the ecosystem, driving the survivors into
    space to develop colonies on other planets. Con-Human then makes Earth into a
    giant fortress and is assembling a massive armada to destroy the remaining
    survivors, but before it can attack, the survivors amass a first strike in order
    to reclaim the Earth.
    .
    The goal is to fly around in the level, using the primary laser weapon to
    destroy various enemies flying in and out of the screen.  Players can upgrade
    this weapon by collecting "L" icons floating around when enough enemies are
    destroyed.  There is also a secondary weapon, a lock-on missile launcher, that
    has the ability to fire upon eight different ground enemies at once.

  description:
    Cast as one of two brave cops, players of Virtua Cop are charged with bringing
    down an evil crime syndicate that is running riot in some unspecified town.
    Dropped into a series of locations, one or two players must arm up and shoot
    their way through three death filled levels, in an attempt to restore peace and
    order. Played from a first person perspective view, players can use keys or
    joypad, to aim and fire at the multitude of sharp shooters who come gunning for
    them.\n
    Starting the game armed with just a trusty old six-shooter, players can pick up
    more powerful, state-of-the-art weapons -- such as machine guns and shotguns --
    as they progress. As these are hidden away in crates and the like, finding these
    weapons is an important part of the game and they can give players extra
    firepower when they most need it. In particular, such weapons can be extremely
    useful when trying to take on the customary end-of-level bosses. Made of stern
    stuff, you'll need all the help you can get in dispatching them off to hell.

    Jewels of the Oracle is a stationary puzzle game with no real story line or

    others. Most of them can be played in two difficulty levels (Easy or Hard), and
    the Oracle provides clues to help along the way.
    .
    The graphics for the puzzles are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style.
    Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off,
    if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle's well.
    There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where
    you begin the game. In each room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel
    which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.

    The puzzles in this game can be compared to those found in The 7th Guest. The

    "Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense
    of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was
    hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for
    yearly revisions of the concept.
    .
    There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of
    other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the
    time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents
    and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and
    systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.
    .
    The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game
    even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system
    .
    FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown
    players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and
    Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to
    match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can
    also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World

    The game is played via a third person view which is just behind the character
    and you look over his shoulder. The game is based underwater in a submarine so
    the developers have added a claustrophobic feeling by giving some areas a
    limited amount of air so you have to run through to activate the air circulation
    system. Controls are your typical Resident Evil style which is you pull the
    Right shoulder button to draw your gun, your d-pad to aim and then a button to
    shoot. Along your journey of the submarine, you will need to find objects such
    as keycards to unlock doors and better weapons.

    by Sega AM2 and released in 1992. Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept
    application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the
    "Model 1". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully
    developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal
    graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari
    (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of
    polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple
    camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a
    greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most
    influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent
    3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider

    Clockwork Knight 2 is the second (and to this date, last) game featuring the
    adventures of Sir Tongara de Pepperouchau III. It maintains the same game style
    (a mixture of 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D elements, moderately in the
    fashion of Sega Saturn's Bug!), colorful music and gameplay of its predecessor.
    However, your mission will be somewhat different this time (although still
    related with Clockwork Princess Chelsea), as the ending scene of the first game
    did not come as good as expected and because of that, you should try to give the
    best of yourself again in order to completely recover Chelsea for Pepperouchau.

    After Virtua Racing, Daytona USA and Sega Rally, yet another classic SEGA arcade
    racer (this time, from the Model 2C CRX architecture) is converted for home
    users. After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the popular European
    Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real
    models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel
    Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive
    (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive
    (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid).
    Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any
    of the previous titles by Sega.
    .
    Like with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an "Arcade"
    and a "PC"/"Saturn" mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and
    inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual Championship (three
    races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also
    available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual
    with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front
    bumper) are at the disposal of the player.\n
    As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those
    proficient in the game.
    .
    Another feature was the "Global Ranking" mode, where players of either version
    could e-mail Sega of Japan a password containing his times, and compare them to
    the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only "Global Net

    You play the game as Scud, a "disposable assassin", who has been hired to take
    out a target in the "Marvin's Manikan" factory. Based on the underground comic
    by Rob Schrab, Scuds are designed to self destruct after they have destroyed
    their target... Scud has become aware of this fact, and instead only injures his
    target enough to not self-destruct. But, being a robot, Scud has no money, and
    must turn to freelance jobs to pay for his original target's life support. The
    game can be played with either a controller or the Virtua Stunner (or other
    compatible light gun). With a controller, the game is a side scrolling
    shoot-em-up; but with a light gun, it becomes a first person shooter. You can
    play with any combination of controllers and guns, but the game is essentially
    meant to be played with two guns (Scud himself uses two guns). The game is
    fueled by music from "DJR/IB3 LTD." (Darryl J. Reavis & Illuminado Berrios,
    III), Fidget-X, and Unbelievable Jolly Machine

    world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot.
    During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special

    attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks.
    The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will

    dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.

  description:
    You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have
    no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its
    pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world.
    But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your
    hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with
    the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no
    option but to explore.
    .
    Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a
    character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described
    in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game
    is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the
    environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is
    not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into
    mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.
    .
    The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

  description:
    Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms,
    aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit
    points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes,
    causing damage to everyone around.
    .
    Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from
    his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time
    limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses
    health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or
    offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player
    can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn
    ends.
    .
    There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is
    affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others
    include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and
    girders.
    .
    There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land
    and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the
    ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.

    characters from the Marvel comic universe. The gameplay is very similar to
    X-Men: Children of the Atom, but with a simplified Super Combo gauge and the
    addition of infinity gems. Each character starts with a set of gems. These can
    be activated during a fight to improve speed, power and defence, or provide
    special abilities to create crushing stone walls, open up a rift in space, or
    reverse the opponent's controls. The use of the gems is inspired by the The
    Infinity Gauntlet comic book series.

    There are ten playable characters. The heroes are Captain America, The
    Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Psylocke, Spider-Man and Wolverine. The villains are
    Blackheart, Juggernaut, Magneto and Shuma-Gorath. Anita from the Darkstalkers

    girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden,
    one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge
    begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of
    his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also
    after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or
    are there more?

    "Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't

    the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D
    world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot.
    During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special
    attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to
    attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks.
    The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will
    be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available
    dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.

    Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents)[1] is a 1993 science fiction
    horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is
    considered one of the most significant and influential titles in the video game
    industry, for having ushered in the popularity of the first-person shooter
    genre. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was
    distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release
    of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold
    at retail.
    .
    In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became
    popularly known as "Doomguy", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons
    from Hell.[2] With one third of the game, nine levels, distributed as shareware,
    Doom was played by an estimated 15â€“20 million people[3] within two years of
    its release, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture.
    In addition to popularizing the FPS genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics,
    networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and
    modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as "WADs". As a sign of
    its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in
    the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as
    "Doom clones". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the
    subject of controversy.
    .
    The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth
    (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995),
    and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for PC DOS, the games have later been
    ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in
    1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to
    countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the
    technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans
    have continued making WADs, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The
    franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a
    retelling of the original game using new technology, and an associated 2005 Doom
    motion picture. Doom 4 was announced as in production in 2008 and was later

  description:
    Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into
    the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter.  The Virtua Fighter
    series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving
    gameplay.
    .
    In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers.
    Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua
    Fighter 2.  Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to
    appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.
    .
    Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been
    difficult.  But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options.  The
    most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run
    under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of
    gameplay.  Other options are unlockable while playing the game.
    .
    One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include
    more selectable characters.  Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua
    Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that
    can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the
    arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter
    2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.
    .
    This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the
    United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.

  description:
    A futuristic racing game with hover cars, in the same line as Wipeout, using a
    modified version of the Magic Carpet 2 engine.
    .
    Gameplay takes a straightforward approach, with the directional keys controlling
    the steering and throttle, and three keys to fire the minigun, missiles or
    charge the booster. While the minigun has unlimited ammo, both fuel, armour and
    missiles must be replenished by passing through some marked areas or picking up
    powerups in the track or by left destroyed opponents. While the vehicles float
    on the track they are still influenced by the ground material: they slow down on
    dirt and even more on water. Each track has a number of shortcuts or alternate
    routes that offer powerups, and some tracks feature gates and ramps that open or
    close randomly.
    .
    Includes 9 tracks and several game modes (for Saturn owners and PC players with
    the 1.2 patch installed) such as single race mode (with option to change the
    number of laps), a Championship mode, Split Screen, Clone Race (beating the
    ghost of the best race time), Death Match (Where instead of finishing first what
    matters is finish alive and with the most kills) and Hot Seat, where up to eight
    players can compete in the same race by taking turns, with the computer taking
    control of the players' vehicles waiting for their turn. There are six hover
    cars to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder
    and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition
    to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster capacities
    can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race. There are Eight teams to
    choose from, which change the colour of the vehicle: Mad Medicine (white),
    Bullfrog (aqua green), Storm Riders (purple), Fire Phreaks (orange), DethFest
    (blue), Foo Fighters (yellow), Gorehounds (red) and Assassins Anonymous (black).

    Mr. Bones is a unique game released exclusively for the Saturn. It combines
    several different types of gameplay. Some levels are side-scrolling action, some
    have a top-down perspective, and still others are single-screen mini games.
    .
    The story is meant to be a humorous horror tale. An evil wizard known as
    Dagoulian has created an army of skeleton warriors, and he plans to use this
    army to conquer the world. Fortunately for us, one of the skeletons he raised,
    Mr. Bones, was not obedient to his commands. You play as Mr. Bones as he
    attempts to both escape from Dagoulian and put and end to his plot.

    There is a lot of video to watch in Mr. Bones. In fact, there is so much video
    that the game uses 2 CD-ROMs. The video is a combination of computer-generated
    animation and live action. Mr. Bones is a computer generated character, while

  description:
    A port of the most successful arcade racer ever, the home versions of Daytona
    USA include the same elements that made the original version successful: three
    highly detailed tracks, arcade driving physics that challenge the player to find
    the best trajectory to make a flying lap without kissing the rails and beating
    the checkpoint timer. The 40 cars of the Easy race (later named 3-7 Speedway),
    one of the stalwarts of the original version, are also present in this version.
    .
    These home versions include a new mode (Saturn or PC Mode, depending on the
    platform) where the three tracks are played without the timer, and optionally in
    mirror mode, using one of the bonus cars (with additional abilities such as
    driving on grass or hitting the rails without losing speed) and in one of three
    lengths: Normal (identical to the arcade original), Grand Prix (2.5 times
    longer) and Endurance (10 times longer).
    .
    On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the
    limited hardware of the Saturn and Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of
    multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the arcade version.

    Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament
    with the grand finale being held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers,
    young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on mind. All
    eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with
    a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the
    catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and
    former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky,
    plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.
    .
    While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting
    Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and
    equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be
    broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more
    vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the
    wall or floor after a throw.
    .
    Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably  faster,
    with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button,
    instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the
    first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which
    allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet,
    avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving
    him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.
    .
    Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game
    options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds
    before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if
    the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes:
    Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega
    Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to
    perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to
    change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.
    .
    Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or
    fighting demos recorded by the AM#2 staff, each with the ability to choose a
    camera. As usual with Sega's fighting ports, extensive bookkeeping is included,
    as well as a few hidden characters.

    that loop around other rides.

    Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and

    maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running
    smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.
    .
    You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage
    over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability
    closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that
    research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

    You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony
    complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict
    spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every
    mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a
    certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.
    .
    Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers,
    chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of
    which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens,
    you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected
    by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your
    mission.
    .
    Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart
    gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout
    the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and
    seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles
    and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and

    Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon
    games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.
    .
    The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The
    Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to
    discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of
    present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young
    girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden,
    one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge
    begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of
    his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also
    after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or
    are there more?
    .
    "Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't
    have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact
    the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D
    world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot.
    During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special
    attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to
    attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks.
    The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will
    be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available
    dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.

    FIFA 97 (also known as FIFA Soccer 97) is a video game developed by EA Canada
    and published by Electronic Arts based on the game of football (soccer). It was
    released for the PC on June 24, 1996 and versions for PlayStation, SNES, Mega
    Drive and Sega Saturn followed.
    .
    FIFA 97 was the fourth game in the FIFA Series and the second to use the Virtual
    Stadium engine. Unlike the first game to use the engine, FIFA 97 features
    polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in FIFA Soccer '96. The
    engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation
    versions.
    .
    David Ginola (then a Newcastle United player) graced the cover of the game in
    the European market. He also was used for motion capture for the polygonal
    models in the game. Bebeto (the Brazilian striker) was featured on the cover for
    the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets.

  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another
    dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role
    of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun
    it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to
    Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming
    countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.
    .
    id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter.
    Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels
    themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more
    natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic
    lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay:
    grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.
    .
    In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels
    (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything
    that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there
    is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in
    id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few
    hidden levels.
    .
    Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments
    with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so
    easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with
    a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in
    environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons
    and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a
    departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by
    earth colors.
    .
    The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed
    with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels
    include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers
    and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while
    relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe,
    there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt,
    which discharges electrical energy.
    .
    Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition
    to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is
    most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and
    free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and
    skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be
    used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for
    deathmatch.

    more than an old geezer and Lion Rafale, who's fighting for his freedom. Each
    fighter has his own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the
    powerful slams of Jeffry.
    .
    Home port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game
    modes include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer
    character progressively learns and counters players' technique), Ranking Mode
    (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on
    number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two
    teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five
    characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and
    then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in
    Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game,
    adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick
    and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the
    player is able to control their fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent
    outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the quickest,
    which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves
    that require more button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with
    the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the physics-defying leaps), and
    each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.
    .
    While in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical
    quality (such as the texture details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn
    High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps  to bring the arcade experience home.

    different cars. As well as the main championship, there is a time-trial mode
    featuring a ghost car to beat, so you always know how your run compares with

  description:
    Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into
    the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter.  The Virtua Fighter
    series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving
    gameplay.
    .
    In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers.
    Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua
    Fighter 2.  Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to
    appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.
    .
    Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been
    difficult.  But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options.  The
    most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run
    under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of
    gameplay.  Other options are unlockable while playing the game.
    .
    One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include
    more selectable characters.  Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua
    Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that
    can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the
    arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter
    2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.
    .
    This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the
    United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.

    .
    The crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation.
    All of a sudden, the ship emergency program woke them up. What has happened?
    Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now Laura,
    the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her
    way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to
    defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because
    they are totally invisible.
    .
    The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you
    enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st
    person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through
    ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are
    invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an
    enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the
    side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the
    distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.

    Virtua Racing or V.R. for short, is a Formula One racing arcade game, developed
    by Sega AM2 and released in 1992. Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept
    application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the
    "Model 1". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully
    developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal
    graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari
    (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of
    polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple
    camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a
    greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most
    influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent
    3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider
    audience

    .
    Home port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game
    modes include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer
    character progressively learns and counters players' technique), Ranking Mode
    (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on
    number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two
    teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five
    characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and
    then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in
    Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game,
    adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick
    and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the
    player is able to control their fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent
    outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the quickest,
    which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves
    that require more button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with
    the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the physics-defying leaps), and
    each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.
    .
    While in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical
    quality (such as the texture details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn
    High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps  to bring the arcade experience home.

    Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament
    with the grand finale being held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers,
    young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on mind. All
    eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with
    a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the
    catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and
    former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky,
    plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.
    .
    While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting
    Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and
    equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be
    broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more
    vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the
    wall or floor after a throw.
    .
    Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably  faster,
    with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button,
    instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the
    first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which
    allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet,
    avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving
    him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.
    .
    Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game
    options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds
    before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if
    the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes:
    Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega
    Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to
    perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to
    change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.
    .
    Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or
    fighting demos recorded by the AM#2 staff, each with the ability to choose a
    camera. As usual with Sega's fighting ports, extensive bookkeeping is included,
    as well as a few hidden characters.

    destroying everything in your path. There is a multitude of enemies and you can
    destroy almost every single thing on the map (buildings, vehicles, etc.). The
    reason for all this destruction is a revolution led by the robots against their

    Athlete Kings is a conversion of the 1995 Sega coin-op Decathlete in which you
    get to compete in all 10 events involved in a Decathlon. The game is split into
    two modes. First is the Decathlon mode itself in which you can play through all
    10 events in standard order.
    .
    Points are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you
    will be rewarded with your final decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode
    which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game.\n
    In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must
    achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've
    qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.

    NHL 98 features much faster and refined gameplay (now using four action keys
    instead of two, removing the need to double-tap to perform some actions), along
    other new features such as "in-the-fly" tactics developed by Marc Crawford, then
    manager of the Colorado Avalanche and new commentary lines from Jim Hughson and
    Darryl Reaugh and a re-worked interface.\n
    Graphics are improved from the previous version with the players being less
    angular, and thanks to 3Dfx support, with less pixels showing in the textures.
    The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while
    displaying stats during clock stoppages.
    .
    As far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with
    professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international
    competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes
    include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1,
    3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.

    player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to
    shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses
    possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots
    results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent
    happily scores goals.

  description:
    In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are
    being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent
    to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is
    suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on
    your wits and the defence software to fend them off.
    .
    The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams
    connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You
    must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and
    scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.
    .
    A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major
    base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor
    intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more
    access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you
    can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of
    success.
    .
    As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time
    to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to
    self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.

    Enemy Zero is one of the horror titles by Warp, closely connected to D (and its
    sequel D2 for Dreamcast). It also features the same heroine as in D series.
    .
    The crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation.
    All of a sudden, the ship emergency program woke them up. What has happened?
    Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now Laura,
    the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her
    way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to
    defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because
    they are totally invisible.
    .
    The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you
    enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st
    person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through
    ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are
    invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an
    enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the
    side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the
    distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.

    The game is played via a third person view which is just behind the character
    and you look over his shoulder. The game is based underwater in a submarine so
    the developers have added a claustrophobic feeling by giving some areas a
    limited amount of air so you have to run through to activate the air circulation
    system. Controls are your typical Resident Evil style which is you pull the
    Right shoulder button to draw your gun, your d-pad to aim and then a button to
    shoot. Along your journey of the submarine, you will need to find objects such
    as keycards to unlock doors and better weapons.

    Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 (known as Sega Worldwide Soccer PC for the PC and
    Victory Goal Worldwide Edition in Japan) is a football video game by Sega
    released for the Sega Saturn in 1996. It is the successor to Victory Goal and
    was later followed by three more titles: Sega Worldwide Soccer '98 still on the
    32-bit console and two editions of Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000, the second being
    Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000 Euro Edition for the Dreamcast.
    .
    Sega Worldwide Soccer 97, produced by Sega themselves was one of the killer apps
    in the peak of popularity for the console.[1] It was preceded by Victory Goal,
    an already ageing football game (one of the debut titles of the console). The
    game featured international teams and league, play-off and tournament modes.
    Although it used fictional player names (due to the lack of a license), the
    non-volatile memory of the Saturn allowed editing of names. The team kits were
    as close to the official 1996 kits as possible. The gameplay was also highly
    praised, and was the top-rated football game until ISS 64 was released one year
    later. Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 was later ported to the PC, under the title of
    Sega Worldwide Soccer PC.

  description:
    Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots
    of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story
    starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you
    must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind
    behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be
    taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.
    .
    The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone
    who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also
    be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D
    characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled
    like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to
    NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the
    Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences.
    .
    The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique
    "friendship" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each
    other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to
    give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as
    the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear,
    spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is
    going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully
    intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be
    very comfortable with the combat system.
    .
    It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force
    III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series
    of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of
    Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the
    storyline.

    Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from
    Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.
    .
    Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony
    Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a
    mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play
    Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand
    Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.
    .
    Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and
    also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions
    were 3D by default.
    .
    Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would
    later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the
    introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy
    of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This
    meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball.
    On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was
    inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a
    swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.
    .
    Other highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:
    .
    - A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a
    proposed trade was in its best interest.
    .
    - Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each
    batter's strengths and weaknesses.
    .
    - Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow
    bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star
    Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game
    JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.
