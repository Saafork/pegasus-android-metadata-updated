  proprietary technology to allow switching from one scene to another without lag,

  for the game's plot, involving the new-guy, Ace (the player), and a host of

  personalities. It's basically play one-on-one on a warehouse court and climb the

description:
  Willy Beamish is a kid who likes to goof off and have fun. Naturally all the
  grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room,
  etc. But now that's school's out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a
  good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However
  Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a
  challenge to get out of it.
  .
  The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You
  play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life
  without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal with parents, teachers,
  babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to
  ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up
  grounded.
  .
  The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles
  have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at
  the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy's
  relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are
  resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when
  it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.

  screw around. Why wreck an old house when the pit latrine is so much more
  tempting? The whole game is presented in full motion video - the reactions are

  lovely Ms. Martin. This time, you should not let them die a gruesome death!
  Because "nice people" can sometimes turn out to be... yes, that's right -
  vampires. The whole house is full of traps, that are intended to catch the poor
  innocent girls, so that the vampires can suck their blood... ugh. Luckily, the
  brave adventurer is there in order to cease to be hunted and to become a hunter
  instead! Set the traps so that they will capture the villains themselves, using
  precise timing and good organization.

  Night Trap was the very first game that used the FMV (full-motion video)
  technology with live actors. Although it didn't contain nudity or particularly
  gory scenes, it was considered one of the first games to have a mature content.

  People & Places, Sports & Leisure, History, Arts & Entertainment, Science &
  Nature, and Wild Card. Answering the trivia question correctly lets you take

  for each category color), the correct answer grants you a colored pie piece in
  your pie-dish marker for that category. Once you have all 6 pie pieces in your
  dish, you need to head back to the hub for a final random question to win the

developer: Delphine Software International
publisher: Delphine Software International
description:
  Heart of the Alien is a cinematic platformer video game developed by Interplay
  Entertainment and Virgin Interactive and was released by Virgin Interactive in
  1994 for the Sega CD exclusively in North America. It is a sequel to Another
  World and continues the story directly from where the original ended. The game
  switches the player's role from Another World; this time the player takes
  control of Buddy, the main character's alien ally from the previous game.
  .
  The story picks up immediately after the end of Another World. Buddy lands the
  pterodactyl in the ruins of his village, lays Lester down on a cot to rest and
  walks through the village, thinking of his past. This sequence contains many
  flashbacks of events that lead up to Buddy's capture and his and Lester's escape
  from prison. In the game, Buddy is searching for the red-eyed alien responsible
  for the destruction of his village and the imprisonment of his people. Buddy
  enters again the prison in search of the red-eyed alien.
  .
  Near the end of the game, Lester who wakes back up, helps Buddy out, but then
  dies in the process. Buddy then goes to find again the red-eyed alien in a
  fortress. Eventually, he is able to find him and traps him in a cage with a
  beast that kills him. At the end of the game, Buddy gives Lester's body a
  ceremonial cremation. It is shown later how Buddy's village is rebuilt with its
  citizens living again in harmony.

game: Heimdall
file: Heimdall (USA).chd
developer: JVC
publisher: JVC
description:
  You play as Heimdall, a demi-god based in Norse mythology. Heimdall's job is to
  protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including
  the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy
  the gods and ultimately everything.
  .
  Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of
  mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three
  worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds
  to collect the god's weapons.
  .
  The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants)
  and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15
  islands and each island has countless rooms.
  .
  When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well
  you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as
  well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do
  well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the
  better ones will not be available to you.
  .
  The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a
  young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails
  and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles
  all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase
  and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight
  (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being
  thrown overboard).
  .
  Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving
  puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually
  find one of the god's missing weapons.

  After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and

  both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in
  the series.
  .
  Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time
  the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards
  (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new
  animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the
  goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is
  completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or
  "regular season" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all
  new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the
  establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes
  (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no
  offsides).

description:
  The first of Digital Pictures' "Make My Video" line has you "editing" three of C
  + C Music Factory's most famous songs - "Gonna Make You Sweat," "Things That
  Make You Go Hmm..." and "Here We Go Let's Rock & Roll."
  .
  The plot puts you inside the music factory of the game's name, where two linemen
  sweat and toil under the oppressive thumb of a wheelchair-bound corporate
  executive. Video discs literally roll down an assembly line while C + C record
  their sounds behind three closed doors. You are asked to help out in editing
  these videos, appease the corporate masters, and lift the burden from everyone.
  .
  The game is played from a panel meant to resemble and act as a non-linear
  editor. Editing is entirely linear however, as three distinct video "feeds" run
  simultaneously along the bottom of the screen. Each is mapped to the A, B, or C
  button, and pressing one sends that video to master viewer, where it is
  recorded. The D-pad toggles various effects on and off from a bin in the upper
  left. One feed will always be of C + C's actual video, with the other two
  holding appropriate stock footage (like a doorbell timed to appear with the
  lyrics "Ding dong, who is it?")
  .
  The video can not be stopped or rewound once the editing process begins, so the
  player must quickly route video to the viewer and apply effects within a given
  amount of time. This allows for editing challenges, where the player must fill
  specific requests, like having fast cuts or showing no dancers.
  .
  After a video is edited, the player gets to watch their cut in its entirety.
  They are then graded by the FMV characters and move to the next song, or try a
  new edit of the previous one.

  complete those tasks, he will encounter the governor Elaine Marley, fall in love
  with her, and face the anger of the dreadful ghost pirate LeChuck?! This is when
  Guybrush' adventure truly begins!
  .
  The Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command
  verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in  Maniac Mansion: you construct
  commands for Guybrush by clicking on the appropriate verb, and then clicking on
  the inventory item or an object in the room you want to interact with. It is the
  first LucasArts' adventure game in which it is impossible to get irrevocably
  stuck or to die. The branching dialogue system, where you choose one of the
  available responses while talking to people, allows you to talk to characters in
  different ways without fearing a wrong choice. There are plenty of
  inventory-based puzzles to solve, and even "insult swordfighting" to participate
  in, where Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword!

  Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in
  each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how
  good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides
  can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer
  operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges
  quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set
  pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and
  then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be
  selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these
  combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders,
  midfielders and strikers cover.

  you must mend the damage your car has sustained, which eats up your prize money.
  Background music is selected through a dashboard CD player, which also features

game: Road Rash

developer: Electronic Arts

description:
  This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those
  who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road
  Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the
  race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to
  cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if
  they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the
  same to you during the next race that takes place.
  .
  There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway,
  Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as
  the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops
  driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike
  near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your
  bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for
  damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding.
  Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again
  another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five
  circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.
  .
  There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups.
  Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you
  proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike
  class.
  .
  If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash
  mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money
  involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against
  fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to
  start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in
  the last place.
  .
  The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the
  races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists,
  including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs
  can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.

  landmarks help keep you driving in the right direction, while accidents, track

developer: Working Designs
publisher: Working Designs
description:
  Vay is the story of Prince Sandor of Lorath, and his quest to avenge the
  assassination of his parents and rescue his beloved Lady Elin. On what is to be
  the day of their wedding, Castle Lorath is assaulted by the Danek, who have been
  able to partially reconstruct alien mecha technology from a millennium ago. The
  castle defenses are powerless against the giant robots, and the king and queen
  are killed in the attack. The invaders steal Elin in the midst of her wedding
  vows. Prince Sandor, now the king of the realm, sets out to rescue his
  betrothed, and find a way to defeat the fearsome alien technology.
  .
  The game is a thoroughly "old-school" Japanese-style RPG, meaning that the focus
  of the game is on fighting random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining
  experience and gold in process, without any additional gimmicks. The characters
  come with pre-set "classes" (wizard, bard, etc.), and learn their own
  abilities/magic spells automatically as they level up.

  direction pad. Correct timing hits the enemy harder, lowering their health bar.

  peasants and soldiers. The common folks that strive to kill Frankenstein's
  monster are highly ignorant about modern science and believe that he is truly a
  demon.

  Frankenstein's monster carries can be put on fire if swung towards fire.
  Frankenstein also has an additional attack; a blue ball of negative energy that
  pops up when the player releases the button. Peasants in the game can either be
  male or female; soldiers are always male. The female peasants attack with pots
  while the male peasants attack with melee weapons. However, the soldiers (men

  chests. There are ten different spells, the "recipes" which are contained in
  scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain

  accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a
  quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas
  of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more.\n
  Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic
  bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he
  looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If

  experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the
  drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the

  protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the
  movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.

  of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional
  shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual
  World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different
  approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging
  obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to
  Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person
  and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel
  with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

  by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of
  the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten
  tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be
  conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament
  and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the
  undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament
  required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm,
  enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into
  the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special
  Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny
  Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary
  Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

  Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one
  on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and
  special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their
  second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality"
  on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically
  kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.
  .
  Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its
  use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of
  copious amounts of blood during gameplay.

  doing this. There are also power-ups that make you grow again.

description:
  A FMV rail shooter placing you in the helmet of rookie chopper gunner "Joker."
  Terrorists have kidnapped a German biochemist and taken him to a Middle Eastern
  oil refinery, where he is forced to work on a lethal toxin. Joker and crew must
  fly to the refinery, shooting down enemy tanks and helicopters, then Joker must
  rappel down to the refinery and rescue the chemist on foot.
  .
  The helicopter sections follow a pattern similar to Tomcat Alley, showing brief
  clips of the cast in the cockpit, followed by a "nose camera" shot of an enemy
  approaching. During this shot, you have the ability to move a set of crosshairs
  over the enemy and press the "fire" button. If you're on target, you are
  rewarded with military archival footage of helicopters shooting rockets, and
  close up footage of models exploding.
  .
  The on-foot sections follow an identical pattern, though with hand-held cameras
  placing you in the "eyes" of Joker, and black-clad guards taking the place of
  helicopters. Otherwise, the idea of having a few seconds to react and aim
  crosshairs is the same. The plot is expanded through occasional cutscenes in
  both the helicopter and foot sections.
